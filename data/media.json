        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Google Cloud) outlines how AI-aware networking—via GKE Inference Gateway, Cloud Load Balancing and GKE—optimizes inference by using specialized metrics (KV cache utilization, queue depth), prefix/body-based routing, and service extensions. These capabilities route requests to least-loaded replicas, reuse prefill/cache work to reduce cold starts and GPU waste, and insert guardrails at the network edge to block invalid prompts before they consume model compute.",
        "bullets": [
          "AI workloads need inference-specific metrics (KV cache, queue depth) because CPU metrics don’t reflect GPU saturation.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway + AI-aware load balancing uses prefix caching and shadow copies to reuse prefill computations and lower GPU load.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA-awareness let the network pick appropriate model replicas and APIs without complex topologies.",
          "Service Extensions enable API management and AI guardrails in the traffic path to sanitize prompts/responses before hitting models.",
          "Result: fewer cold starts, higher GPU saturation, lower latency, reduced TCO and compute waste."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Higher GPU saturation changes power planning: expect more sustained rack-level power draw rather than just short CPU spikes—size PDUs, UPS and cooling for steady GPU loads.",
          "Caching and prefill reuse reduce per-request compute and energy; deploy inference-aware routing to lower energy per inference and defer hardware expansion.",
          "Network-edge guardrails can block invalid or unsafe requests before GPU use—implement edge filtering to save costly compute and associated energy.",
          "Telemetry must include inference metrics (KV cache, queue depth) for accurate capacity planning and to avoid routing traffic to congested GPUs.",
          "Low-latency, high-bandwidth intra-datacenter networking becomes more critical—ensure fabric and switch uplinks support the reduced-latency routing these strategies require."
