        "summary": "Based on the available description, Google Cloud explains how networking must become AI-aware to properly support inference workloads. They describe GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing that use inference-specific metrics, prefix caching, body-based routing, and service extensions (including guardrails) to reduce latency, improve GPU utilization, and cut costs.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional networking and round‑robin load balancing miss GPU saturation because CPU metrics don't reflect inference load.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing use specialized metrics (e.g., KV cache utilization, queue depth) to identify least‑loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow cache copies let the gateway reuse prefill computations, reducing cold starts and GPU work.",
          "Body‑based routing and LoRA adapter awareness enable routing by model/context and unify multi‑model APIs.",
          "Service Extensions insert API management and AI guardrails at the network edge to sanitize prompts/responses and avoid wasted GPU cycles."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Better GPU utilization directly reduces energy per inference and can lower peak power and cooling requirements in data centers.",
          "Reducing cold starts and intelligently routing work can smooth demand spikes—helpful for capacity planning and managing site power/UPS loads.",
          "Network‑level guardrails that block invalid or policy‑violating requests save compute and energy by preventing needless GPU usage.",
          "Adoption requires new telemetry (KV cache use, queue depth) and orchestration integration—plan for updated monitoring and ops workflows.",
          "Higher sustained GPU saturation may change future procurement and rack‑level power budgeting (fewer idle GPUs, different redundancy assumptions)."
