        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno outlines how Google Cloud is making networking \"AI-aware\" to improve inference performance by using the GKE Inference Gateway, AI-aware load balancing, and service extensions. These techniques (inference-specific metrics, prefix caching, body-based routing and in‑network guardrails) aim to raise GPU utilization, cut latency and lower total cost of ownership while streamlining developer workflows.",

          "Body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness enable model identification and smarter request steering.",
