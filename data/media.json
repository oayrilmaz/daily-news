          "Incorporate space-weather monitoring and alerting into operational procedures so power and data-center teams can implement pre-planned mitigation steps during solar events.",
          "Use scientific visualization tools (like OpenSpace referenced in the video) to brief stakeholders and run scenario training for extreme-space-weather impacts on infrastructure."
