Eksperci KPMG analizują także specyfikę polskiego rynku (wzrost mimo globalnych spadków), segmentację klientów, rolę sztuki i turystyki premium oraz przyszłe wyzwania związane z AI i rzemiosłem.",

          "Wzmianka o AI jako elemencie przyszłości luksusu sugeruje potrzebę przygotowania infrastruktury wspierającej obciążenia obliczeniowe AI (GPU, chłodzenie, skalowalność).",
          "ESG i certyfikacje w sektorze luksusowym oznaczają presję na dostawców infrastruktury na niższe zużycie energii, zieloną energię i transparentność wskaźników efektywności (np. PUE).",
          "Rozwój luksusowej turystyki i hoteli w Polsce wskazuje na potrzebę lokalnej odporności i możliwości skalowania mocy w sezonach szczytowych.",
          "Silna segmentacja klientów i usługi o wysokiej wartości podkreślają konieczność bezpiecznego przetwarzania danych osobowych i zgodności z regulacjami."
