        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Product Manager, Cloud Networking at Google) explains how networking must become AI-aware to support inference workloads. Google Cloud’s approach—using GKE Inference Gateway, AI-aware load balancing and service extensions—leverages inference-specific metrics and network-level guardrails to improve GPU/TPU utilization, reduce latency and lower costs.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional network metrics (e.g., CPU) and round-robin LB can send traffic to congested replicas, harming latency and efficiency.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing use inference-specific signals (KV cache utilization, queue depth) to pick least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching, body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness let the network reuse prefill work and route requests to replicas with relevant context.",
          "Service Extensions enable inserting API management and AI guardrails in the traffic path to sanitize prompts/responses before reaching models.",
          "Outcomes include fewer cold starts, higher GPU/TPU saturation, lower TCO and the ability to block invalid requests before spending compute."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Higher GPU/TPU saturation reduces wasted cycles and energy per inference—plan for higher sustained rack power draw but better work-per-kW.",
          "Reduced cold-starts and smarter routing smooth demand spikes, helping capacity planning for power, cooling and UPS provisioning.",
          "Network-level guardrails that drop invalid or policy-violating requests before model execution can materially cut wasted compute costs and power use.",
          "Operators should invest in inference-specific telemetry (KV cache, queue depth) and integrate it with orchestration to avoid misleading CPU-based metrics.",
          "Consolidating API management and security at the network layer can simplify topology and reduce duplicated infrastructure across model fleets, shrinking footprint and operational complexity."
