        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno from Google Cloud explains how AI-aware networking (via GKE Inference Gateway and Cloud Load Balancing) addresses AI inference’s unique traffic patterns by using specialized metrics and routing. The approach adds prefix/body-based routing, cache-aware load balancing, LoRA adapter awareness, and network-level service extensions for API/guardrail insertion to reduce latency, improve GPU utilization, and cut costs.",
