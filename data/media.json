        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Product Manager, Cloud Networking at Google) explains how networking must be AI-aware to support efficient inference. He outlines Google Cloud’s approach—GKE Inference Gateway plus AI-aware load balancing and service extensions—that uses inference-specific metrics, prefix caching, body-based routing and guardrails to reduce latency, maximize GPU utilization, and simplify governance.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional networking and round-robin load balancing miss GPU saturation and send traffic to congested replicas.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing use metrics like KV cache utilization and queue depth to pick the least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow copies let the gateway reuse prefill computations to avoid repeated work and reduce cold starts.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA-adapter awareness enable routing by model/context; service extensions let you insert API management and guardrails in the network path.",
          "Network-level guardrails can sanitize or reject prompts before they hit GPUs, preventing wasted compute and improving security."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Higher GPU saturation from AI-aware routing can reduce total cost of ownership and lower required compute capacity—important for data center procurement and power budgeting.",
          "By avoiding wasted GPU cycles (e.g., rejecting invalid prompts at the edge), facilities can cut unnecessary energy use and cooling demand per inference.",
          "Better routing that minimizes cold starts and evens load can reduce peak/variable demand, easing capacity planning and improving the fit with on-site renewables or energy storage.",
          "Service extensions and unified networking-based APIs simplify deployment and governance, reducing operational complexity for multi-model AI environments.",
