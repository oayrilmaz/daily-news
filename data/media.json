        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno of Google Cloud outlines how networking must evolve to support AI inference by using AI-aware traffic routing, specialized load balancing, and service extensions to improve GPU utilization and lower latency. He highlights GKE Inference Gateway, inference-specific metrics (like KV cache utilization and queue depth), prefix caching, body-based routing, LoRA adapter awareness, and network-level guardrails that sanitize prompts before they consume GPU cycles.",

          "Traditional networking and CPU-based metrics miss GPU saturation, causing blind load balancing and latency.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway + AI-aware load balancing uses inference-specific metrics (KV cache use, queue depth) to pick least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow cache copies let routers reuse prefill computations to reduce GPU work and cold starts.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA-awareness enable routing by model/context to appropriate replicas and APIs.",

          "AI-aware routing and cache reuse can reduce peak GPU demand and cold-start spikes, lowering data center power and cooling peaks.",
          "Network-level guardrails that block invalid requests before model execution cut unnecessary GPU cycles and energy use, reducing TCO.",
