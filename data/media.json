        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Product Manager, Cloud Networking at Google) explains how networking must be AI-aware to properly support inference workloads. He outlines Google Cloud’s approach—using the GKE Inference Gateway, AI-aware load balancing, and service extensions—to optimize GPU utilization, reduce latency and cold starts, and insert guardrails into the traffic path.",

          "Uses inference-specific metrics (e.g., KV cache utilization, queue depth) to identify and route to least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow copies let the load balancer reuse prefill computations to reduce GPU work and cold starts.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness enable routing based on model identity and adapters in requests.",
