        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno explains how Google Cloud uses AI-aware networking (GKE Inference Gateway and Cloud Load Balancing) to route inference traffic using specialized metrics like KV cache utilization and queue depth, plus features such as prefix caching, body-based routing, and LoRA adapter awareness. The approach also adds Service Extensions to insert API management and AI guardrails at the network edge, reducing cold starts, improving GPU/TPU utilization, lowering latency, and preventing wasted compute on invalid requests.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional networking and round-robin load balancing miss GPU/TPU saturation—AI-aware metrics are required to find least-loaded replicas.",
          "Inference gateway maintains shadow prefix caches and can reuse prefill computations to reduce GPU work and latency.",
          "Body-based routing and model-aware routing enable routing to replicas with the correct model/context (including LoRA awareness).",
          "Service Extensions let teams insert API management and AI guardrails into the traffic path to sanitize prompts/responses before they hit models.",
          "Result: fewer cold starts, higher GPU saturation, lower TCO, faster developer velocity, and edge-based rejection of invalid requests to save compute."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Capacity and power planning should account for AI-specific load patterns—specialized metrics (cache use, queue depth) give better signals than CPU alone for GPU/TPU demand.",
          "Prefix caching and reuse can reduce peak GPU compute and short-duration power spikes, easing requirements for surge provisioning and cooling.",
          "Network-level guardrails that reject invalid prompts before they reach models can materially cut wasted GPU cycles and operational energy costs.",
          "Adding Service Extensions and inference-aware routing shifts some processing into the network layer—expect impacts on network throughput, latency budgeting, and edge appliance placement.",
          "Unified API/routing that increases developer velocity may raise sustained inference volumes—plan for higher baseline power, rack space, and GPU licensing/availability."
