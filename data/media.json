        "summary": "Victor Moreno, Product Manager for Cloud Networking at Google, explains how networking must be AI-aware to support inference workloads by using specialized metrics, inference-specific routing, and service-level extensions. Google Cloud's approach—centered on the GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing—aims to improve GPU utilization, reduce latency and cold starts, and insert guardrails and API management into the traffic path.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional network metrics (e.g., CPU) and round-robin load balancing miss GPU saturation and can send traffic to congested replicas.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing use inference-specific metrics like KV cache utilization and queue depth to identify least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow copies let the gateway reuse prefill computations and route requests to replicas with pre-existing context to reduce GPU work and latency.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness enable model identification and more precise routing for multi-model deployments.",
          "Service Extensions let API management and AI guardrails run in the network path to sanitize prompts/responses and block invalid requests before they reach GPUs."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Monitoring and capacity planning should incorporate inference-specific metrics (KV cache use, queue depth) because CPU metrics can miss GPU saturation.",
          "Network-level routing and prefix caching can reduce cold starts and improve GPU utilization, which affects power draw patterns and TCO for GPU-heavy racks.",
          "Inserting guardrails at the network edge can prevent wasted GPU cycles on policy-violating or malformed requests, lowering compute costs and associated energy use.",
          "Service Extensions and unified API routing can simplify network topologies and governance, reducing operational complexity for data center and cloud network teams."
