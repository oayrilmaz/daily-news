        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Product Manager, Cloud Networking at Google) explains how networking must be AI-aware to support efficient inference. Google Cloud’s approach uses the GKE Inference Gateway, inference-specific metrics, prefix/body-based routing, and service extensions to improve GPU utilization, reduce latency, and insert guardrails before requests reach models.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional networking and CPU-based metrics miss GPU/TPU saturation, causing blind load distribution and latency spikes.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway + AI-aware load balancing use inference metrics (KV cache utilization, queue depth) to identify least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow copies let the network reuse prefill computations to avoid cold starts and lower GPU work.",
          "Service Extensions enable inline API management and AI guardrails to sanitize prompts/responses at the network edge, preventing wasted GPU runs.",
          "Products mentioned: GKE Inference Gateway, Cloud Load Balancing, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Higher GPU saturation via AI-aware routing reduces idle cycles and lowers energy per inference—important for data center power and cooling budgets.",
          "Network-side guardrails can avoid unnecessary GPU computation, saving compute costs and associated electricity consumption.",
          "Reducing cold starts and latency improves user experience and can reduce peak provisioning needs, impacting capacity planning for racks and power infrastructure.",
          "Deploying inference-specific telemetry and routing may require upgraded network telemetry, interconnects, and orchestration—consider implications for switch/transport capacity and resiliency.",
          "Unified APIs and in-network service extensions can simplify operations and reduce deployment sprawl, affecting space, power, and lifecycle planning in data centers."
