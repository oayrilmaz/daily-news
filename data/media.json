        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Product Manager, Cloud Networking at Google) explains how networking must be rethought for AI inference, highlighting AI-aware routing, specialized load balancing, and service extensions to optimize GPU-backed inference. He outlines GKE Inference Gateway and Cloud Load Balancing features—like KV-cache and queue-depth metrics, prefix caching, body-based routing, and network-level guardrails—that reduce latency, improve GPU saturation, and prevent wasted compute.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional networking and CPU-based metrics miss GPU/TPU saturation, causing inefficient replica selection and higher latency.",
          "GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing use inference-specific signals (KV cache utilization, queue depth) to pick least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow cache copies let the system reuse prefill computations and reduce GPU work for common prompts.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness enable routing by model/context, simplifying multi-model deployments.",
          "Service Extensions insert API management and AI guardrails at the network edge to block policy-violating requests before they consume GPU resources."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Visibility: Data centers must collect inference-specific telemetry (cache hits, queue depth) in addition to CPU/GPU metrics to avoid hidden GPU saturation and mis-provisioning.",
          "Energy & cost savings: Caching and smarter routing reduce wasted GPU cycles (and therefore power and cooling demand), lowering TCO for AI workloads.",
          "Capacity planning: AI-aware load balancing can smooth demand peaks and reduce cold starts, allowing more predictable power and space provisioning.",
          "Security & operational efficiency: Network-level guardrails can block invalid or risky requests before they hit GPUs, saving compute cost and simplifying enforcement without complex topologies."
