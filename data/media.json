        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno from Google Cloud explains how AI-aware networking (using GKE Inference Gateway and Cloud Load Balancing) routes inference traffic with specialized metrics and techniques to optimize GPU utilization and reduce latency. He also describes Service Extensions that insert API management and AI guardrails into the network path to sanitize prompts and avoid wasted model compute.",
        "bullets": [
          "Inference-aware load balancing uses metrics like KV cache utilization and queue depth rather than CPU to identify the least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow copies enable reuse of prefill computations to cut GPU work and minimize cold starts.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness help direct requests to the correct model/context-specific replicas.",
          "Service Extensions allow seamless insertion of API management and guardrails to block invalid prompts before they consume GPU resources.",
