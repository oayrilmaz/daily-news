        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno (Google Cloud) explains how AI-aware networking—centered on GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing—uses inference-specific metrics (KV cache utilization, queue depth), prefix caching, body-based routing and service extensions to optimize GPU utilization, reduce latency, and simplify governance. Network-level AI guardrails can sanitize prompts at the edge to block invalid requests before they consume GPU cycles, improving cost-efficiency and developer velocity.",
        "bullets": [
          "Traditional metrics (CPU) and round-robin load balancing miss GPU saturation; inference-aware metrics let the gateway identify and route to least-loaded replicas.",
          "Prefix caching and shadow copies at the load balancer reuse prefill computations to reduce GPU work and minimize cold starts.",
          "Body-based routing and LoRA adapter awareness let traffic be directed to replicas that match model/context requirements.",
          "Service Extensions enable insertion of API management and AI guardrails in the network path to enforce policy and sanitize prompts/responses.",
          "Google Cloud products referenced: GKE Inference Gateway, Cloud Load Balancing, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)."
        ],
        "takeaways": [
          "Higher GPU saturation through smarter routing can reduce the number of GPUs required, lowering data center power, cooling and capital expenses.",
          "Reusing prefill/cache and reducing cold starts smooths demand spikes, aiding power provisioning and reducing the need for overprovisioned electrical/thermal capacity.",
          "Edge guardrails that drop invalid requests before model execution cut wasted GPU compute and energy consumption, reducing operating cost.",
          "Adopting inference-aware networking requires exposing and integrating new metrics into load balancers and orchestration, which informs more accurate capacity planning for power/UPS/cooling."
