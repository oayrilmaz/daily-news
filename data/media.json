        "summary": "Based on the available description, Victor Moreno outlines how Google Cloud uses AI-aware networking (GKE Inference Gateway and AI-aware load balancing) to optimize AI inference. The approach leverages inference-specific metrics (KV cache utilization, queue depth), prefix/body-based routing, and service extensions to improve GPU utilization, lower latency, and insert guardrails at the network edge to avoid wasted compute.",
        "bullets": [
          "Problem: traditional networking and standard metrics miss GPU saturation and send traffic to congested replicas, increasing latency and inefficiency.",
          "Solution: GKE Inference Gateway + AI-aware load balancing use metrics like KV cache utilization and queue depth to identify least-loaded replicas and stack-rank targets.",
          "Optimization techniques include prefix caching (reusing prefill computations), body-based routing for model identification, and LoRA adapter awareness.",
          "Service Extensions let operators insert API management and AI guardrails in the network path to sanitize prompts/responses before they reach models.",
