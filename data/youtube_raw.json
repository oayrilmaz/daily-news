        "description": "After saying he would use military force to take over Greenland, and raise tariffs on countries who oppose him, President Donald Trump has walked back on both threats. \n \nHe has also said he has agreed the &quot;framework of a future deal&quot; with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But that agreement does not appear to grant him the full control he was seeking.\n \nSo why has President Trump changed his tune? And what will leaders across Europe make of this?\n \nWe get the details from our Europe correspondent Nick Beake.\n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\n#BBCNews",
