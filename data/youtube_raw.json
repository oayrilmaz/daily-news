Add to that heightened geopolitical tensions across the globe and you have a recipe for a mass flight to gold. And that’s exactly what central banks and investors have been doing. \n\nNow with China seeking to offer an alternative to American dominance, we look at what gold’s historic rise means for the global financial system. \n\nRead more: Why Investors Can’t Seem to Get Enough of Gold\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/gold-price-record-how-us-china-tensions-fed-cut-bets-are-driving-bullion-rally\n\nSign up for the Economics Daily newsletter to discover what's driving the global economy and what it means for policy makers, businesses, investors and you.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/new-economy-daily\n\n00:00 Gold’s Record Surge\n01:22 Titlecard\n01:59 Historical Context and US Dollar Concerns\n02:51 The Debasement Trade Explained\n03:52 Federal Reserve Pressure and Interest Rate Dynamics\n04:32 Impact of Geopolitical Tensions\n05:28 China’s Central Role in Gold Markets \n06:32 US Dollar’s Declining Reserve Status\n06:55 ETF Demand and Investment Flows\n07:22 Rally Across Silver and Platinum\n08:10 Cryptocurrencies\n08:18 Future Outlook \n\n#gold #TheFed #tariffs #Trump #China #ETFs #bitcoin \n\n\n--------\nLike this video?
