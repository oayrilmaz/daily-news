        "description": "President Trump wrapped up his second and final day at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nThe President held an inauguration for his new “Board of Peace” and met with Ukraine’s President Zelensky - which Zelensky said included agreeing post-war security guarantees for his country. BBC chief North America correspondent Gary O’Donoghue and the Economist’s Shashank Joshi break it all down.\n\nAnd the former Labour Minister Andrew Gwynne confirmed his plans to retire on medical grounds triggering a by-election that could pave the way for Andy Burnham to run and ultimately launch a leadership challenge against Keir Starmer.

        "description": "After saying he would use military force to take over Greenland, and raise tariffs on countries who oppose him, President Donald Trump has walked back on both threats. \n \nHe has also said he has agreed the &quot;framework of a future deal&quot; with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But that agreement does not appear to grant him the full control he was seeking.\n \nSo why has President Trump changed his tune? And what will leaders across Europe make of this?\n \nWe get the details from our Europe correspondent Nick Beake.\n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\n#BBCNews",
