        "description": "The Duke of Sussex was visibly emotional as he told a court the life of his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, had been made &quot;an absolute misery&quot; by the publisher of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\n\nPrince Harry was speaking as he concluded his evidence in his case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) at the High Court, much of which focused on articles about his relationships before meeting Meghan.\n\nThe prince's voice broke as he said the court battle had been a &quot;horrible experience&quot; for his family and that all he wanted was &quot;an apology and some accountability&quot;.\n\nHe is one of seven high-profile claimants accusing ANL of &quot;grave breaches of privacy&quot; over a 20-year period. The publisher has denied wrongdoing.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#PrinceHarry #BBCNews",

        "description": "US President Donald Trump says he is seeking immediate negotiations to acquire Greenland, which he called a &quot;vast, almost uninhabited and undeveloped country, sitting undefended&quot;.\n\nHe told world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland: &quot;We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be frankly unstoppable. But I won't do that&quot;\n\nThe US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-west - a facility it has operated since World War Two. \n\nUnder existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Trump #Greenland #BBCNews",
