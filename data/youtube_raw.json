        "description": "Donald Trump's sweeping use of tariffs in the first nine months of his second term was sharply questioned during oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n \nChief Justice John Roberts, and justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch – three conservative jurists considered swing votes in this case - peppered US Solicitor General John Sauer, representing the president's administration, during his more than 45 minutes before the court.\n \n&quot;The justification is being used for power to impose tariffs on any product from any country in any amount, for any length of time,&quot; Roberts said.\n \nIf the court ruled for Trump in this case, Gorsuch wondered: &quot;What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce?&quot;\n \nHe added that he was &quot;struggling&quot; to find a reason to buy Sauer's arguments.\n \nThe case centres around a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), that Trump's lawyers have said gives the president the power to impose tariffs. Although the Constitution specifically vests Congress with tariff authority, Trump has claimed that the legislature delegated &quot;emergency&quot; authority to him to bypass longer, established processes.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#DonaldTrump #Tariffs #BBCNews",
