        "description": "Hundreds of illegal dumps are operating across England, including at least 11 so-called &quot;super sites&quot; containing tens of thousands of tonnes of rubbish, a BBC investigation has found.\n \nMore than 700 illegal tips were shut down in 2024/25, but data released by the Environment Agency has revealed some 517 dumps were still active at the end of last year.\n \nPolice said many are run by organised crime gangs, who are making cash by charging much less than legitimate operators to take and bury waste.\n \nAn Environment Agency spokesman said it was committed to tackling waste crime and was &quot;pulling every lever to disrupt those who profit from the harm illegal waste sites cause&quot;.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#England #Environment #BBCNews",

        "description": "The BBC has been given access to detention facilities on former United Arab Emirates military bases in Yemen, confirming long-standing allegations of a network of secret prisons run by the UAE and forces allied to it in Yemen's decade-long civil war.\n\nAt one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation, and messages on the walls which appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held.\n \nUntil recently, the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, was allied with the UAE against the Houthi rebel movement which controls north-west Yemen.\n\nBut the alliance between Yemen's two Gulf state partners has fractured causing UAE forces to be pulled out of Yemen in early January.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Yemen #BBCNews",
