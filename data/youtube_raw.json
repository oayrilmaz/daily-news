        "description": "Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping - the first time a British prime minister has visited the country since 2018. \n \nStarmer said he wants to achieve a &quot;comprehensive and consistent approach to China&quot;. \n \nThe visit comes amid controversy over China's alleged human rights abuses and security concerns over a planned Chinese 'mega-embassy' in London.\n \nStarmer is the latest of a string of Western leaders to visit China - earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing and reached a new trade agreement with China, saying his country was adjusting to a &quot;new reality&quot; of a &quot;new world order&quot;, in the wake of US President Trump's agenda and tariffs. \n \nWhile Donald Trump's trade policies have strained ties with traditional US allies, China has been fostering relationships with other countries including the UK, Canada and India.\n \nWe speak to our China correspondent Laura Bicker from Beijing to discuss the perks and pitfalls of trading with China. \n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#China #GlobalPower #BBCNews",
