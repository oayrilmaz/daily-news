        "description": "UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the country won't sign up to US President Donald Trump's proposed Board of Peace yet, because of concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.\n\nCooper described the board as a &quot;legal treaty that raises much broader issues&quot; than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nSome of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, no other permanent members of the UN Security Council - the five nations with the most powerful roles in international affairs - have not committed to participation so far.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an &quot;everlasting&quot; peace in the Middle East.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Trump #UK #UN #BBCNews",

        "description": "Donald Trump has backed down over Greenland - ruling out his previous threats to seize the island by force - and withdrawing his plan to impose new tariffs on countries opposing his proposals. \n\nInstead the US President told world leaders meeting in Davos, Switzerland that he is seeking immediate negotiations to acquire the island.   He said: “We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be frankly unstoppable. But I won't do that.”\n\nHe also said is dropping plans to add a 10% tariff to goods from eight European countries over their opposition to his push to acquire Greenland. \n\nHis wide-ranging speech, in which he appeared to confuse Greenland with Iceland four times, lasted more than an hour.\n\nIn a post on social media Trump says he has “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland&quot; after talks with Nato's secretary general, Mark Rutte. \n\nUS markets rose sharply following the announcement.  The news offered some relief for the US's European allies, who had been facing the possibility of an armed stand-off with their NATO ally.   \n\nHowever President Trump's new position leaves many questions unanswered, with allies unclear on US policy towards Greenland going forward.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason and Katya Adler. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
