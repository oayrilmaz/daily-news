        "description": "The CNBC Housing Market Survey asks over 100 real estate agents about local market conditions and buy/seller sentiment. In the final quarter of 2025, real estate professionals saw prices remaining flat or falling in many parts of the country. Most homes sold by respondents stayed on the market for over 3 weeks – a signal for buyers who’ve delayed purchases as prices hover near record levels. As a result, a growing cohort of agents are reducing their asking prices for listings – or pulling them off the market entirely.\n\nProduced by: Lisa Rizzolo\nReported by: Diana Olick\nEditing and Graphics by: Carlos Waters\nSenior Managing Producer: Shawn Baldwin\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images, Heather Dell\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Today, the US has seized two oil tankers — one Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic and another ship in the Caribbean. Both vessels have links to Venezuela.\n\nThe UK supported US efforts to seize the Russian-flagged ship, which is accused of breaking US sanctions by shipping Iranian oil.\n\nWhat do we know so far and is this the closest Russia and the US have been to confrontation since the Cold War? Adam is joined by BBC international editor Jeremy Bowen and Michelle Wiese Bockmann, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward.\n\nAlso in the studio is BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, who’s back from a visit to Google HQ in California, where they are developing a quantum computer which could have capabilities beyond anything the world has yet seen. Faisal fills us in on what he learned from his trip.",
