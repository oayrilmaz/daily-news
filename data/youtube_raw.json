Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him.\n\nVictoria Derbyshire and Simon Jack stand in for Laura and Paddy, joining Henry to discuss the latest accusations as well as what options are left for politicians, and the Royal Family, as Giuffre’s brother asks for the King to strip Andrew of his title as Prince.\n\nPlus, how do we get our energy bills down? Energy secretary Ed Milliband, his shadow Claire Coutinho, and Green party leader Zack Polanski all spoke to Victoria this morning and offered alternative visions. But what do the public want?\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
