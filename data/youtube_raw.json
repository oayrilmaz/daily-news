Transaction volume was 10% lower year-over-year in November 2025, with just 1,800 deals overall, according to monthly data provided by Moody's as a media exclusive to CNBC's Property Play. However, investors are leaning toward larger-scale acquisitions and bigger, higher-quality assets. All transaction sizes dropped markedly in November, except those sales greater than $100 million, which were 51% higher year-over-year. This pushed the average deal size in November to $14.2 million, compared with an average of $12 million since the start of 2019. The largest deal was a $7.2 billion medical office portfolio of 296 properties in 34 states was sold by Welltower to a joint venture of Remedy Medical Properties and Kayne Anderson Real Estate. The second-largest sale of the month, totaling $615 million, involved three industrial properties.

        "description": "European leaders have united in condemning President Trump’s threat of new tariffs against allies who oppose his plan to annexe  Greenland.    \n\nA joint statement of European leaders said:  “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral”.  The statement, signed by the leaders of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland said: “We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.” \n\nThe UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the US president in a phone call that he was wrong to make such a threat against NATO allies.    \n\nThe EU made clear it could impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods or even consider economic sanctions against the United States if the US tariffs were imposed.  The head of the European Council announced an emergency summit and said  the EU showed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion”.\n\nEurope’s stance could place it on a collision course with the US.  Trump has said he will place sanctions on eight European nations, including the UK, that have deployed troops to Greenland in response to US threats over its future.\n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Nick Beake, Joe Pike, Faisal Islam and Katya Adler.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

At least 25 of the injured are reported to be in a serious condition.    Rescue workers are at the scene and searching for survivors in the wreckage. \n\nThe accident happened on the main rail line from Malaga to Madrid, near Adamuz, in the province of Cordoba.

They would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached.\n\nLaura and Paddy are joined by chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman and The Sun on Sunday’s political editor Kate Ferguson to talk through what it all means, and what it might do to Keir Starmer’s ‘special relationship’ with Trump. \n\nThey also talk about why the news might be a bit awkward for Nigel Farage and his Reform Party.\n\n#BBCNews",
