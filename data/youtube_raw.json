The Russian president is yet to be presented with the latest US-led proposal on how to end the war in Ukraine, after Donald Trump spoke positively about progress made during multilateral talks in Berlin.  \n\nThis week, Lucy is joined in the studio by the BBC’s chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, security correspondent Frank Gardner, and Europe digital editor Paul Kirby, to answer your questions. Could a plan to redeploy frozen Russian assets crash Europe’s economy? Which competing visions are at play inside the White House as the US ramps up peace efforts?

        "description": "BREAKING NEWS:  Thousands of documents from two criminal investigations into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been released in the United States.   \n\nAmong the files are details of Epstein's contacts book, revealing new details of his association with wealthy and powerful people.\n\nThe first folder released on the Department of Justice website \n contains photographs taken during an FBI search of Epstein's Manhattan home. One image shows black-gloved hands holding up a piece of paper with the address of what was Epstein's primary residence.\n\nAmong the files are many new photographs.  Some show the former US president Bill Clinton, apparently in a hot tub and also in a swimming pool.  Another shows Mr Clinton alongside Epstein.  The former president has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein’s abuse. \n\nOther photographs shows Epstein with Mick Jagger and the Microsoft boss Bill Gates.   Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Many of those identified in other releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. \n\nThere are new pictures of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former partner and confidante, who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nEpstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution in 2008.   Later allegations were not brought  to trial, because he was found dead in his jail cell in New York in 2019.\n\nThe files were released on the day of a legal deadline for the Justice Department to make the information public.  However the US Deputy Attorney-General said not all the files are being released. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Tom Bateman and Andrew Verity.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
