        "description": "Thousands of civilians in Myanmar have fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a series of air strikes.\n \nThe junta has also launched a ground offensive in rebel-held areas, aiming to recapture territory ahead of phased elections that start on 28 December.\n \nThe election is widely criticised as a sham put on by the junta to legitimise its grip on power. It seized control of the country in a coup in February 2021 and since then Myanmar has been plunged into a civil war with rebel groups trying to overthrow the junta. \n \nThe BBC’s Yogita Limaye, Sanjay Ganguly and Aamir Peerzada gained exclusive access to civilians and rebel fighters ahead of the election.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
