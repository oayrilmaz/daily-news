        "description": "Many Americans struggle to make ends meet even with two incomes but it wasn’t always this way. For a lot of the 20th century, a single income could support a middle-class lifestyle for certain workers. Historians and economists have traced the rise of dual-income households to long-term shifts in the U.S. economy. The majority of six-figure earners say living on one income feels nearly impossible, according to a recent Harris Poll. Meanwhile, Bank of America Institute data shows 26% of U.S. households spend more than 90% of their income on basic needs. While rising costs for childcare, housing, and education are part of the equation, historians and economists point to deeper structural changes in the labor market, including wage stagnation and the expansion of gig and temporary work, as key forces reshaping what it takes to afford a middle-class lifestyle. Watch the video above to learn more about how economic change has redefined what it takes to support a family today.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:52 Worker protections\n3:25 The rise of insecure work\n7:01 Today’s household math\n\nProduced by Charlotte Morabito\nEdited by Andrea Miller\nAnimation Jason Reginato, Emily Park, Mithra Krishnan\nSenior Director of Video Lindsey Jacobson\nAdditional Footage Getty Images\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "After Donald Trump's incendiary interview this week, in which he called European leaders &quot;weak&quot; and questioned Ukraine's commitment to democracy, current messaging from the White House appears to be aligned with longstanding Kremlin rhetoric. So as Europe's 'coalition of the willing' assemble for a new round of talks, can they level the playing field for Ukraine in peace negotiations?\n \nOn this episode of Ukrainecast, Jamie Coomarasamy and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined by BBC Verify's Olga Robinson and Russia editor Steve Rosenberg to answer your questions. Could Ukraine really hold wartime elections? Have any western assets been frozen by Moscow? And will Russia ever pay reparations for its invasion?\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #ukraine #ukrainewar",

Her grown-up children, who she hadn't seen in two years, were in Oslo to greet her.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#MariaCorinaMachado #Venezuela #NobelPeace #Oslo #BBCNews",

        "description": "The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast. \n\nIn a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks.\n\nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an &quot;illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations&quot;. The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources.\n\nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. \n\nIn recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies. And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #DonaldTrump #Venezuela",
