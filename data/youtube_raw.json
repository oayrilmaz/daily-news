        "description": "The CNBC Housing Market Survey asks over 100 real estate agents about local market conditions and buy/seller sentiment. In the final quarter of 2025, real estate professionals saw prices remaining flat or falling in many parts of the country. Most homes sold by respondents stayed on the market for over 3 weeks – a signal for buyers who’ve delayed purchases as prices hover near record levels. As a result, a growing cohort of agents are reducing their asking prices for listings – or pulling them off the market entirely.\n\nProduced by: Lisa Rizzolo\nReported by: Diana Olick\nEditing and Graphics by: Carlos Waters\nSenior Managing Producer: Shawn Baldwin\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images, Heather Dell\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
