CNBC drove three of them at M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan – a Kia EV6 GT-Line, a Porsche Macan 4S Electric and an Audi RS e-tron GT. The experience proved what insiders say – EVs, in many ways, are superior machines. Yet, with the disappearance of federal support for them, automakers are pulling back on production. U.S. sales lag the rest of the world, and they may fall further now that incentives have dried up.
