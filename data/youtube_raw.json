        "description": "Hundreds of illegal dumps are operating across England, including at least 11 so-called &quot;super sites&quot; containing tens of thousands of tonnes of rubbish, a BBC investigation has found.\n \nMore than 700 illegal tips were shut down in 2024/25, but data released by the Environment Agency has revealed some 517 dumps were still active at the end of last year.\n \nPolice said many are run by organised crime gangs, who are making cash by charging much less than legitimate operators to take and bury waste.\n \nAn Environment Agency spokesman said it was committed to tackling waste crime and was &quot;pulling every lever to disrupt those who profit from the harm illegal waste sites cause&quot;.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#England #Environment #BBCNews",
