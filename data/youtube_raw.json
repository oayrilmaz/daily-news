Once the “green choice,” they have now put a tremendous amount of power at the feet of even ordinary car owners.

The experience proved what insiders say – EVs, in many ways, are superior machines. Yet, with the disappearance of federal support for them, automakers are pulling back on production. U.S. sales lag the rest of the world, and they may fall further now that incentives have dried up. Here’s why EV’s are more powerful than their gas counterparts, why automakers have still struggled to replicate Tesla’s success and what is needed to sell them now.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:28 Chapter 1: From green to mean \n5:15 Chapter 2: How we got here \n8:12 Chapter 3: Declining sales \n12:05 Chapter 4: What's next \n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Nic Golden Henry\nCamera: Sean Baldwin, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato, Mallory Brangan\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Alex Roy, Audi, BMW, Ford, Getty Images, GM, Hyundai Motor Group, Nissan, Rimac, Rivian, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Donald Trump says he will sign a bill to release the Epstein Files after it passed nearly unanimously through both houses of Congress.\n\nIt’s a notable shift in position from the president, who’s come under increasing pressure from Republicans and Democrats to release all files held by the Justice Department on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nWill Trump be able to turn this into a victory, and will he be able to repair the rift that’s been growing among sections of his MAGA base?  \n\nJustin, Sarah and Marianna take a look at what we know so far about Epstein’s relationships with powerful figures in the US, and what we can expect to see from the Epstein Files once they’re released into the public domain.  \n\nAnd we assess just how significant a moment this is in Donald Trump’s second term as president, the tactics he may deploy to turn it into a political victory, and why he told one female reporter to be ‘quiet, piggy’ when asked about the Epstein Files on Air Force One.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #presidenttrump",
