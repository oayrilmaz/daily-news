        "description": "Donald Trump has dismissed suggestions that his plan to take control of Greenland, in the face of opposition by his NATO allies, could lead to the break up of the alliance.  \n\nAsked about a possible threat to the future of NATO, President Trump said: “Something is going to happen which will be very good for everybody.  Nato will be very happy and we will be very happy.  But we need it [Greenland] for security purposes, we need it for national security and even world security.”\n\nAt a press conference at the White House, Donald Trump was also asked how far he was willing to go to acquire Greenland and replied:   “You’ll find out”.   He repeated his threat to impose new punitive tariffs on countries that opposed his plans. \n\nOther leaders intensified their criticism of the US administration.  The French President Emmanuel Macron said that Europe had little regard for bullies and preferred the “rule of law to brutality.”   Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney warned of a “rupture” in the world order.\n\nMr Carney was speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland, where the US President is due to arrive on Wednesday to address world leaders and business elites. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Katya Adler, Chris Mason and Faisal Islam. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
