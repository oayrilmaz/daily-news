But with a shortage of talent, antiquated operating procedures and outdated facilities the industry — essential to U.S. energy security and defense — is in crisis. China dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry accounting for 53% of global market share followed by South Korea and Japan. The U.S. accounts for about 0.1%. But that could soon change. In southern Philadelphia, $5 billion is being invested by South Korean shipping conglomerate Hanwha. It hopes to turn this decades old shipyard into a state of the art facility. To look at how shipyards are being revitalized, CNBC traveled to Wisconsin’s Great Lakes region and to one of America's oldest shipyards in Philadelphia.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - 2:18 Introduction\n2:19 - 5:05 Chapter 1.

        "description": "CNBC Marathon investigates the intricate, high-stakes world of semiconductor manufacturing from the Dutch labs powering AI chip breakthroughs to the billion-dollar fabs reshaping U.S. industry.\nIn a highly secured lab in the Netherlands, ASML spent a decade developing a $400 million machine that’s transforming how microchips are made. High NA is the latest generation of EUV, the only machines in the world that can etch nanoscopic blueprints on advanced chips for giants like Intel, TSMC and Samsung. The size of a double-decker bus, only five of these machines have been shipped so far. It’s unclear how Trump’s tariffs will impact the complex global supply chain for the lithography machines. But without them, no advanced chips can be made by the likes of Nvidia, Apple and AMD. No filming of High NA has ever been allowed until CNBC went to the Netherlands for this exclusive first look.\n\nTexas Instruments is building a $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject where Apple vows to make &quot;critical foundation semiconductors&quot; for iPhones and other devices. CNBC went to Sherman, Texas, for an exclusive first look inside the newest fab of seven TI's building in Utah and Texas to provide U.S.-made chips to customers like Nvidia and Ford. TI shares have suffered amid tariff concerns, and it's lost analog market share for several years, but top leaders are confident about the huge spend.\n\niPhone Air was the big star unveiled by Apple in early September but inside was another hardware set launched that day: three new custom Apple microchips. Apple’s A19 Pro SoC prioritizes AI workloads with neural accelerators added to the GPU cores. Replacing Broadcom and Qualcomm parts is the N1 and C1X, Apple’s first iPhone networking chip and second-generation iPhone modem. CNBC sat down with three Apple executives for the first U.S. interviews about its move to control all core iPhone chips.\n\nThis CNBC Marathon looks at the global race to build AI chips and how Apple is using the chips.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:00: How ASML Makes Chips Faster With Its New $400 Million High NA Machine (Published May 2025)\n18:09: Why Texas Instruments Is Betting $60 Billion On Making Cheap Chips In The U.S. (Published August 2025)\n33:48: How Apple’s New iPhone Chips Enable On-Device AI (Published September 2025)\n\nProduced by: Katie Tarasov\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller, Mike Heffron\nAdditional Camera: Magdalena Petrova, Andrew Evers, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Jason Reginato, Mithra Krishnan, Emily Park\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Editing: Isabel Iino\nAdditional Footage: TSML, Intel, Getty Images, TSMC, Zeiss, Texas Instruments, KTEN, Samsung, Nvidia, Qualcomm\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Many Americans struggle to make ends meet even with two incomes but it wasn’t always this way. For a lot of the 20th century, a single income could support a middle-class lifestyle for certain workers. Historians and economists have traced the rise of dual-income households to long-term shifts in the U.S. economy. The majority of six-figure earners say living on one income feels nearly impossible, according to a recent Harris Poll. Meanwhile, Bank of America Institute data shows 26% of U.S. households spend more than 90% of their income on basic needs. While rising costs for childcare, housing, and education are part of the equation, historians and economists point to deeper structural changes in the labor market, including wage stagnation and the expansion of gig and temporary work, as key forces reshaping what it takes to afford a middle-class lifestyle. Watch the video above to learn more about how economic change has redefined what it takes to support a family today.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:52 Worker protections\n3:25 The rise of insecure work\n7:01 Today’s household math\n\nProduced by Charlotte Morabito\nEdited by Andrea Miller\nAnimation Jason Reginato, Emily Park, Mithra Krishnan\nSenior Director of Video Lindsey Jacobson\nAdditional Footage Getty Images\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
