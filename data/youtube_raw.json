        "description": "Donald Trump has warned Iran that &quot;time is running out&quot; to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.\n\nThe US president said a &quot;massive Armada&quot; was &quot;moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose&quot; towards Iran, referring to a large US naval fleet.\n\nIn response, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country's armed forces were ready &quot;with their fingers on the trigger&quot; to &quot;immediately and powerfully respond&quot; to any aggression by land or sea.\n\nIran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month.\n\nThe US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.  HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.  \n\nAnother group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Caroline Hawley and Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping - the first time a British prime minister has visited the country since 2018. \n \nStarmer said he wants to achieve a &quot;comprehensive and consistent approach to China&quot;. \n \nThe visit comes amid controversy over China's alleged human rights abuses and security concerns over a planned Chinese 'mega-embassy' in London.\n \nStarmer is the latest of a string of Western leaders to visit China - earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing and reached a new trade agreement with China, saying his country was adjusting to a &quot;new reality&quot; of a &quot;new world order&quot;, in the wake of US President Trump's agenda and tariffs. \n \nWhile Donald Trump's trade policies have strained ties with traditional US allies, China has been fostering relationships with other countries including the UK, Canada and India.\n \nWe speak to our China correspondent Laura Bicker from Beijing to discuss the perks and pitfalls of trading with China. \n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#China #GlobalPower #BBCNews",
