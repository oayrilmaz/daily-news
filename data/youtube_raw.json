Were the experts wrong? Or is it too early to tell?\n\nThe seeming end of free trade has caused a frenetic scramble as nations and companies seek to soften the blow. Trump’s gamble on US magnetism appears to have yielded some wins, but whether they last remains to be seen. Is his strategy a way to protect America’s preeminent role in the world, or will it merely hasten its retreat?\n\n--------\nLike this video?

Once the “green choice,” they have now put a tremendous amount of power at the feet of even ordinary car owners. CNBC drove three of them at M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan – a Kia EV6 GT-Line, a Porsche Macan 4S Electric and an Audi RS e-tron GT. The experience proved what insiders say – EVs, in many ways, are superior machines. Yet, with the disappearance of federal support for them, automakers are pulling back on production. U.S. sales lag the rest of the world, and they may fall further now that incentives have dried up.
