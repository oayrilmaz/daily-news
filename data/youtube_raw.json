His administration has previously backed the deal.\n \nThe UK said it has to hand over the islands because the military base is under threat &quot;after court decisions undermined our position&quot;.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Greenland #ChagosIslands #BBCNews",
