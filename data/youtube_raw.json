        "description": "UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the country won't sign up to US President Donald Trump's proposed Board of Peace yet, because of concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.\n\nCooper described the board as a &quot;legal treaty that raises much broader issues&quot; than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nSome of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, no other permanent members of the UN Security Council - the five nations with the most powerful roles in international affairs - have not committed to participation so far.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an &quot;everlasting&quot; peace in the Middle East.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Trump #UK #UN #BBCNews",
