        "description": "After the search for survivors and recovery of victims in tragic aviation accidents — like that of a UPS cargo plane shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky last month — comes the search for flight data and a cockpit voice recorder often called the &quot;black box.&quot;\nEvery commercial plane has them. Aerospace giants GE Aerospace and Honeywell are among a few companies that design them to be nearly indestructible so they can help investigators understand the cause of a crash.\n\nA crash can cost airlines or plane manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars and leave victims' families with a lifetime of grief. And this crucial data can also help prevent future accidents. But in some circumstances black boxes were destroyed or never found.\n\nExperts say further developments such as cockpit video recorders and real-time data streaming are needed. CNBC explores the evolution of black box recorders.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - 1:49 Introduction \n1:50 - 5:36 From aluminum foil to chips\n5:37 - 9:50 How black boxes work\n9:51 - 13:40 The future of flight data recorders\n\nProduced and Edited by: Erin Black\nAnimations by: Emily Park, Jason Reginato\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Reporting: Leslie Josephs\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Police failed to properly investigate allegations that a gang was blackmailing men on the gay dating app Grindr, the BBC can reveal.\n\nOur investigation has learned of five cases of suspected blackmail using Grindr in one area, with at least four of them connected to the same gang, which remains at large.\n\nIn one instance, a suspected victim killed himself 24 hours after a group of men turned up at his home demanding he hand over his new Range Rover.\n \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog has told Hertfordshire Police - the investigating force - to examine whether “homophobic assumptions” could have contributed to failures in the investigation.\n\nHertfordshire Police said it was “unable to discuss specific points” about the case, which has now been reopened, but said it is committed to “building and maintaining good working relationships with the LGBTQ+ communities”.\n\nWarning - this story contains distressing content and references to suicide.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "A California doctor who supplied ketamine to Friends star Matthew Perry has been sentenced to 30 months in prison in the US.  The actor was 54 when he died from a ketamine overdose in 2023, after years struggling with addiction and depression.\n\nDr Salvador Plasencia was one of five charged in a US federal investigation into how Perry acquired the anaesthetic drug through an underground supply network in Hollywood.\n\nThe actor's family asked the judge to impose a lengthy prison sentence, calling Plasencia the &quot;most culpable&quot; of the five people charged.  They talked about their struggle to understand why he had repeatedly supplied Perry with drugs.\n\nPerry’s mother said Dr Plasencia had abused his position, an accusation which the doctor admitted.  He told the court:  &quot;I failed myself. There is no excuse. I can't undo what's been done. I know that. I should have protected him, as his mother said. I'm just so sorry.&quot;\n\nPlasencia had pleaded guilty to four counts of distributing ketamine. The charges carried a maximum of 40 years in prison, although prosecutors had asked for a sentence of three years.\n\nThe four other people charged in the case - including another doctor, his assistant and two people who supplied the ketamine dose that killed Matthew Perry - have also pleaded guilty and are set to be sentenced in the coming months.\n\nBest known for playing Chandler Bing in Friends, the sitcom star had spoken publicly for years about his mental health problems and drug addiction. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Peter Bose in Los Angeles.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
