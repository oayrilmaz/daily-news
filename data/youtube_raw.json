However, investors are leaning toward larger-scale acquisitions and bigger, higher-quality assets. All transaction sizes dropped markedly in November, except those sales greater than $100 million, which were 51% higher year-over-year. This pushed the average deal size in November to $14.2 million, compared with an average of $12 million since the start of 2019. The largest deal was a $7.2 billion medical office portfolio of 296 properties in 34 states was sold by Welltower to a joint venture of Remedy Medical Properties and Kayne Anderson Real Estate. The second-largest sale of the month, totaling $615 million, involved three industrial properties.
