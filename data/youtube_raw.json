As season two of An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet draws to a close, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau looks to the future—traveling from India to Finland and Peru to uncover how people with imagination are forging a new path forward for the planet. From communities in India’s Eastern Ghats overcoming fear of snakes to restore fragile ecosystems, to Helsinki’s bold reimagining of nuclear energy and the reforestation efforts in Peru’s Cusco region bringing water back to the Andes—this episode reveals how challenging assumptions and redefining humanity's relationship with nature can lead to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\n\n\n--------\nLike this video?
