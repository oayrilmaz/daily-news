        "description": "A man who escaped the last functioning hospital in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher before a reported massacre by paramilitary troops says he has lost all hope and happiness.\n\nAbdu-Rabbu Ahmed, a laboratory technician at the Saudi Maternity Hospital, spoke to a freelancer gathering interviews for the BBC from a displaced persons camp in Tawila some 70km (43 miles) to the west of el-Fasher, the regional hub which was taken over by paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the last week of October after an 18-month siege.\n\nThe alleged killings of at least 460 patients and their companions at the Saudi Hospital were one of the most shocking among widespread accounts of atrocities - some of them filmed by RSF fighters and posted to social media.\n\nIn a statement of condemnation, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was &quot;appalled and deeply shocked&quot; by the reported shootings, and by the abductions of six health workers - four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist.\n\nThe RSF has dismissed the accusations as disinformation, declaring that all of el-Fasher's hospitals had been abandoned. It disputed the claims by filming a video inside the hospital grounds showing female volunteers tending to patients.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Sudan #BBCNews",
