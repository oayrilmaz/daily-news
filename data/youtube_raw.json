As a result, a growing cohort of agents are reducing their asking prices for listings – or pulling them off the market entirely.\n\nProduced by: Lisa Rizzolo\nReported by: Diana Olick\nEditing and Graphics by: Carlos Waters\nSenior Managing Producer: Shawn Baldwin\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images, Heather Dell\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "US Vice-President JD Vance says that Europe should take President Trump “seriously” on Greenland after he suggested buying the territory from Denmark or even taking military action to annex it.\n \nPresident Trump claims control of the semi-autonomous Danish territory is vital for national security.\n \nDespite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.\n \nBoth Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Greenland #US #BBCNews",

        "description": "Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine.\n \nAt least four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions.\n \nIt is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n \nIt's an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles).\n \nRussia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
