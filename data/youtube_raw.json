        "description": "The BBC has been able to speak to several Iranians in recent days, as new footage emerges of the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month. \n \nThe internet blackout is now patchy, after weeks where a total shutdown made it difficult to understand what was happening in the country. \n \nThe US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people in Iran since the unrest began and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths. \n \nIranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by &quot;rioters&quot;.\n \nMost international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But, videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Iran #MiddleEast #BBCNews",
