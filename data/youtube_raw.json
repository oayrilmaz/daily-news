To that end, the Labor Department brought back some workers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to release the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. 10 days late, CNBC’s Rick Santelli, Nomura’s David Seif and Richard Bernstein Advisors’s Michael Contopoulos dig into the numbers and what they mean for the data-driven Federal Reserve. It’s the second-longest shutdown in U.S. history, and lawmakers like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) and Senator James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) are standing firm on their respective sides of the standoff. Both explain their perspectives on how the country can move forward.

This is causing fish to migrate - forcing fishermen to travel further and take bigger risks to catch enough. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#SouthKorea #Fishing #BBCNews",
