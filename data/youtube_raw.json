        "description": "Eli Weinstein is a convicted fraudster who stole millions of dollars from investors at the height of the pandemic. He was able to do so because President Donald Trump during his first term commuted his 24-year sentence for a previous conviction. Now Weinstein is said to be planning to ask Trump for clemency again.\n\nWithin months of his release in 2021, Weinstein returned to scamming, stealing from unsuspecting victims until he was caught and convicted again, this time sentenced to 37 years in prison. While the administration contends it carefully weighs all petitions, the case points up what critics argue is a radical new system of how presidential clemency is granted, one where financial resources, connections and politics govern who goes free and who does not. \n\n0:00 The cost of clemency\n1:37 The deal\n3:04 Eli Weinstein’s second chance\n4:45 Doing something good for the world\n5:42 The puppet master\n7:26 The brink of destruction\n10:52 The story isn’t over\n13:34 The purpose of clemency\n15:31 The system\n17:08 Out of chances?\n\nHelp shape the future of Bloomberg Video.

But with a shortage of talent, antiquated operating procedures and outdated facilities the industry — essential to U.S. energy security and defense — is in crisis. China dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry accounting for 53% of global market share followed by South Korea and Japan. The U.S. accounts for about 0.1%. But that could soon change. In southern Philadelphia, $5 billion is being invested by South Korean shipping conglomerate Hanwha. It hopes to turn this decades old shipyard into a state of the art facility.

        "description": "CNBC Marathon investigates the intricate, high-stakes world of semiconductor manufacturing from the Dutch labs powering AI chip breakthroughs to the billion-dollar fabs reshaping U.S. industry.\nIn a highly secured lab in the Netherlands, ASML spent a decade developing a $400 million machine that’s transforming how microchips are made. High NA is the latest generation of EUV, the only machines in the world that can etch nanoscopic blueprints on advanced chips for giants like Intel, TSMC and Samsung. The size of a double-decker bus, only five of these machines have been shipped so far. It’s unclear how Trump’s tariffs will impact the complex global supply chain for the lithography machines. But without them, no advanced chips can be made by the likes of Nvidia, Apple and AMD. No filming of High NA has ever been allowed until CNBC went to the Netherlands for this exclusive first look.\n\nTexas Instruments is building a $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject where Apple vows to make &quot;critical foundation semiconductors&quot; for iPhones and other devices. CNBC went to Sherman, Texas, for an exclusive first look inside the newest fab of seven TI's building in Utah and Texas to provide U.S.-made chips to customers like Nvidia and Ford. TI shares have suffered amid tariff concerns, and it's lost analog market share for several years, but top leaders are confident about the huge spend.\n\niPhone Air was the big star unveiled by Apple in early September but inside was another hardware set launched that day: three new custom Apple microchips. Apple’s A19 Pro SoC prioritizes AI workloads with neural accelerators added to the GPU cores. Replacing Broadcom and Qualcomm parts is the N1 and C1X, Apple’s first iPhone networking chip and second-generation iPhone modem. CNBC sat down with three Apple executives for the first U.S. interviews about its move to control all core iPhone chips.\n\nThis CNBC Marathon looks at the global race to build AI chips and how Apple is using the chips.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:00: How ASML Makes Chips Faster With Its New $400 Million High NA Machine (Published May 2025)\n18:09: Why Texas Instruments Is Betting $60 Billion On Making Cheap Chips In The U.S. (Published August 2025)\n33:48: How Apple’s New iPhone Chips Enable On-Device AI (Published September 2025)\n\nProduced by: Katie Tarasov\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller, Mike Heffron\nAdditional Camera: Magdalena Petrova, Andrew Evers, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Jason Reginato, Mithra Krishnan, Emily Park\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Editing: Isabel Iino\nAdditional Footage: TSML, Intel, Getty Images, TSMC, Zeiss, Texas Instruments, KTEN, Samsung, Nvidia, Qualcomm\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Many Americans struggle to make ends meet even with two incomes but it wasn’t always this way. For a lot of the 20th century, a single income could support a middle-class lifestyle for certain workers. Historians and economists have traced the rise of dual-income households to long-term shifts in the U.S. economy. The majority of six-figure earners say living on one income feels nearly impossible, according to a recent Harris Poll. Meanwhile, Bank of America Institute data shows 26% of U.S. households spend more than 90% of their income on basic needs. While rising costs for childcare, housing, and education are part of the equation, historians and economists point to deeper structural changes in the labor market, including wage stagnation and the expansion of gig and temporary work, as key forces reshaping what it takes to afford a middle-class lifestyle. Watch the video above to learn more about how economic change has redefined what it takes to support a family today.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:52 Worker protections\n3:25 The rise of insecure work\n7:01 Today’s household math\n\nProduced by Charlotte Morabito\nEdited by Andrea Miller\nAnimation Jason Reginato, Emily Park, Mithra Krishnan\nSenior Director of Video Lindsey Jacobson\nAdditional Footage Getty Images\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Almost 90 flights linked to Jeffrey Epstein arrived at and departed from UK airports, some with British women on board who say they were abused by the billionaire, a BBC investigation has revealed.\n\nThree British women who say they were trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK and other documents related to the convicted sex offender.\n\nUS lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims said it was &quot;shocking&quot; that there has never been a major UK investigation into his activities there.  One suggested the UK was a &quot;centrepiece&quot; of Epstein's operations.\n\nTestimony from one of the three British victims helped convict Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell of child sex-trafficking in the United States in 2021.  However the victim has never been contacted by UK police, according to her lawyer.  The woman, given the name Kate in the trial, was listed as having been on more than 10 flights paid for by Epstein in and out of the UK between 1999 and 2006.\n\nUS lawyer Sigrid McCawley said the British authorities have &quot;not taken a closer look at those flights, at where he was at, who he was seeing at those moments, and who was with him on those planes&quot;.\n\nThe flight logs are among thousands of documents from court cases and Epstein's estate which have been made public over the past year.  Fifteen of the UK flights took place after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor, which should have alerted British authorities.\n\nEpstein died in jail in 2019, before his trial on charges of trafficking minors for sex.  Legal experts have told the BBC a UK investigation could reveal whether people based in Britain helped enable his crimes.\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Chi Chi Izundu.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
