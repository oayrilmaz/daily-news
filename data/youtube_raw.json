Imports from China to Brazil have skyrocketed, up nearly 100,000 vehicles in just one year, and Chinese brands like BYD now account for over 80% of electric car sales in Brazil.

In a posthumous memoir, Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always denied the claims.\n \nAlso this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \n#Royals #PrinceAndrew #BBCNews\n\n#BBCNews",
