        "description": "Fresh talks on the future of the war in Ukraine are under way - with delegations from the US, Ukraine, and its European allies holding discussions in Geneva.\n \nAndriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official, says the mood is constructive. And a US official tells the BBC there’s optimism - and momentum, as he put it.\n \nBut what’s on the table is a 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine that reflects Russia’s key demands. Everything from Ukraine abandoning hard-defended land, to a ban on joining Nato.\n \nAnd US President Donald Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday to sign up.\n \nMet with dismay in Ukraine, the deal’s controversial even in the US - where Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to confirm that this is in fact a US proposal, and not one written by the Kremlin.\n \nRubio is here today, as are officials from the European Union and UK anxious to ensure that if this is a starting point for a lasting peace deal - a big if - then Ukraine’s voice, and those of all its allies, must be heard.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
