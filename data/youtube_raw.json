        "description": "US President Donald Trump has said he will tell European leaders &quot;we have to have&quot; Greenland at this week's forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n \nOn social media, Trump shared a message apparently from Emmanuel Macron, in which the French president says: &quot;I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.”\n \nHe also shared a message he said was from Nato's secretary general and posted generated images of himself placing an American flag on Greenland.\n \nGreenland's prime minister said &quot;we will not let ourselves be pressured&quot;, as European allies have rallied to defend the semi-autonomous Danish territory.\n \nMeanwhile Trump has also said the UK's plan to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius is an &quot;an act of GREAT STUPIDITY&quot;. His administration has previously backed the deal.\n \nThe UK said it has to hand over the islands because the military base is under threat &quot;after court decisions undermined our position&quot;.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Greenland #ChagosIslands #BBCNews",
