Blocked from the U.S. by tariffs, China’s EV giants have turned to emerging markets like Brazil to offload their massive supply of cars. Imports from China to Brazil have skyrocketed, up nearly 100,000 vehicles in just one year, and Chinese brands like BYD now account for over 80% of electric car sales in Brazil.

Andrew has always denied the claims.\n \nAlso this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \n#Royals #PrinceAndrew #BBCNews\n\n#BBCNews",
