Seven buildings are operating now, and once complete, the site will have around 30 buildings and consume some 2.2 gigawatts of power. CNBC went to the small town of New Carlisle, Indiana, to talk to locals who are worried about the impact on their community and electric bills - and to get a first ever on-camera tour inside what Amazon’s calling the largest cluster of non-Nvidia chips in the world.
