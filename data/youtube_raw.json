        "description": "Dame Sarah Mullally has been officially confirmed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury in a ceremony rich with centuries-old tradition at St Paul's Cathedral in London.\n \nHer predecessor, Justin Welby, resigned following accusations he did not do enough with information he had about a prolific abuser to prevent further abuse from taking place.\n \nDame Sarah is the first woman to lead the Church of England and told the BBC she is committed to speaking out about misogyny where she sees it and it was right that there was greater scrutiny on her own record in dealing with safeguarding in the Church.\n \nThe ceremony to confirm Dame Sarah was a mix of religious service and legal process - for part of the ceremony, the cathedral became a courthouse where legal rites, written down in 1533 but with their origins much earlier, were enacted.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#ChurchofEngland #ArchbishopofCantebury #BBCNews",
