        "description": "Protests have broken out in Minneapolis after a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old woman in the city.\n\nVideos posted on social media show the moment of the shooting, in which ICE agents approach a car in the middle of a residential street. As it attempts to drive off, one of the agents points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard.\n\nWith the Trump administration characterising the incident as “domestic terrorism”, alleging Renee Good had “harassed” officers all day prior to the shooting, the mayor of Minneapolis has labelled this account “bullshit” and called on immigration officers to get out of the city. \n\nThe governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, is calling for a full investigation but says a fair outcome will be difficult because &quot;people in positions of power&quot; - naming Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem - have &quot;already passed judgement&quot;. \n\nWalz says they've shared information that he says is &quot;verifiably false&quot; and &quot;inaccurate&quot; and made assumptions about Renee Good's character and actions ahead of the shooting.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
