Once the “green choice,” they have now put a tremendous amount of power at the feet of even ordinary car owners. CNBC drove three of them at M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan – a Kia EV6 GT-Line, a Porsche Macan 4S Electric and an Audi RS e-tron GT. The experience proved what insiders say – EVs, in many ways, are superior machines. Yet, with the disappearance of federal support for them, automakers are pulling back on production. U.S. sales lag the rest of the world, and they may fall further now that incentives have dried up. Here’s why EV’s are more powerful than their gas counterparts, why automakers have still struggled to replicate Tesla’s success and what is needed to sell them now.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:28 Chapter 1: From green to mean \n5:15 Chapter 2: How we got here \n8:12 Chapter 3: Declining sales \n12:05 Chapter 4: What's next \n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Nic Golden Henry\nCamera: Sean Baldwin, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato, Mallory Brangan\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Alex Roy, Audi, BMW, Ford, Getty Images, GM, Hyundai Motor Group, Nissan, Rimac, Rivian, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "What do kids want to know about the war in Ukraine? On this special Q&amp;A edition of Ukrainecast, we’re teaming up with Newsround (the BBC's children's news programme) to find out. To mark World Children’s Day, we took a panel of BBC experts to Hammersmith Academy, a secondary school in London, to respond to questions from a live audience.\n\nVictoria Derbyshire and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined on this episode by Newsround presenter Ricky Boleto, and Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse. Why did the war start? Are there really any safe places in Ukraine? And who is working towards making peace? They answer all that, and we hear from some of those Ukrainian children who have been forced to start a new life in the UK.\n\nIf young listeners found any parts of this episode upsetting, you can find advice and support on the Newsround website: https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #BBCNews",
