        "description": "A landmark social media addiction trial in which top tech executives are expected to testify begins on Tuesday in California.\n \nThe plaintiff, a 19-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of the platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.\n \nThe defendants include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - TikTok's owner ByteDance and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled their case with the plaintiff last week. \n \nThe closely-watched case at Los Angeles Superior Court is the first in a wave of such lawsuits, which could challenge a legal theory used by tech firms to shield themselves from culpability in the US.\n \nMeta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online, and the companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#SocialMedia #Meta #ByteDance #Google #US #BBCNews",
