        "description": "In 2023, Giulia Tramontano was murdered by her partner in Milan, Italy. She was seven months pregnant at the time of her death. \n\n137 women and girls around the world are killed by an intimate partner or family member every day. That’s according to the most recent data from the United Nations.  \n \nIn an effort to curb violence against women, Italy has now become the latest country to adopt a specific law around the murder of a woman – on account of her gender.   \n \nLast month, the Italian parliament voted unanimously to introduce this term “femicide” into the country’s legal code.  \n \nNow, there’s ample debate about whether this new law will actually change the reality for women – or whether it’s purely symbolic.  \n\nGiulia's sister, Chiara Tramontano, speaks to Asma Khalid from the Global Story Podcast. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #femicide #violenceagainstwomen \n\nChapters:\n00:00 What is 'femicide'?\n02:07 Who was Giulia Tremontado\n03:17 Who was Giulia's partner? \n05:30 Giulia's goes missing\n08:00 Giulia's body is found\n10:10 The trial \n13:00 The femicide law \n14:00 The need for education\n16:15 A message to my niece \n18:50 A turning point for women",
