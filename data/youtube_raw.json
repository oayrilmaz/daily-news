        "description": "Donald Trump's claim that Nato troops stayed &quot;a little off the front lines&quot; during the war in Afghanistan has sparked outrage from UK politicians and veterans' families.\n \nThe US president told Fox News on Thursday that he was &quot;not sure&quot; the military alliance would be there for the US &quot;if we ever needed them&quot;.\n \n&quot;They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,&quot; he said, &quot;and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines&quot;.\n \nHealth and Social Care Minister Stephen Kinnock called Trump’s remark “disappointing”, and said the UK and other allies had &quot;always stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States&quot; and contributed to US-led missions.\n \nThe UK was among several allies to join the US in Afghanistan from 2001, after it invoked Nato's collective security clause following the 9/11 terror attacks.\n \nA total of 457 British service personnel were killed in the conflict.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#DonaldTrump #Nato #BBCNews",
