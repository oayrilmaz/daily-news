Once the “green choice,” they have now put a tremendous amount of power at the feet of even ordinary car owners.

The experience proved what insiders say – EVs, in many ways, are superior machines. Yet, with the disappearance of federal support for them, automakers are pulling back on production. U.S. sales lag the rest of the world, and they may fall further now that incentives have dried up. Here’s why EV’s are more powerful than their gas counterparts, why automakers have still struggled to replicate Tesla’s success and what is needed to sell them now.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:28 Chapter 1: From green to mean \n5:15 Chapter 2: How we got here \n8:12 Chapter 3: Declining sales \n12:05 Chapter 4: What's next \n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Nic Golden Henry\nCamera: Sean Baldwin, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato, Mallory Brangan\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Alex Roy, Audi, BMW, Ford, Getty Images, GM, Hyundai Motor Group, Nissan, Rimac, Rivian, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
