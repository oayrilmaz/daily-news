        "description": "It was Aug. 30, 2020. The Gulf Livestock 1 was steaming into the path of Maysak, a Category 4 typhoon that was hurtling up the Philippine Sea with 130 mph winds and 20-foot waves. Even the sturdiest cargo ship would take a beating in such conditions. But for the Gulf, Maysak spelled catastrophe.\n\nGulf Livestock 1 was due to arrive at Tangshan, a massive Chinese port complex about 100 miles from Beijing, in four days. It was the height of pandemic gridlock in ports around the world, especially in China, where ships often waited more than two days to offload. For the Gulf, which carried a shifting, easily frightened cargo of 5,867 dairy cattle, every extra day at anchor heightened the risk of the animals becoming ill or dying—and of costing the exporter and ship owner money.\n\nThe ship continued its route towards China. The eventual sinking of Gulf Livestock 1 was the worst disaster in the history of the live-export trade, an industry made up of about 150 ships with a market value totaling as much as $30 billion. While the industry’s size makes it a tiny fraction of the $2.2 trillion global commercial shipping fleet, which numbers around 100,000 vessels, the live-export fleet was already disproportionately prone to catastrophic accidents.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit investigative news organization.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:30 Live export industry\n3:49 Gulf Livestock 1\n5:37 2020 journey\n8:00 After the sinking\n10:38 New findings\n14:32 Global reactions\n15:58 Safety improvements\n17:00 Industry outlook\n18:14 Conclusion\n\n--------\nLike this video?

        "description": "EV’s have quicker acceleration than gas cars and reaching higher top speeds. Once the “green choice,” they have now put a tremendous amount of power at the feet of even ordinary car owners. CNBC drove three of them at M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan – a Kia EV6 GT-Line, a Porsche Macan 4S Electric and an Audi RS e-tron GT. The experience proved what insiders say – EVs, in many ways, are superior machines. Yet, with the disappearance of federal support for them, automakers are pulling back on production. U.S. sales lag the rest of the world, and they may fall further now that incentives have dried up. Here’s why EV’s are more powerful than their gas counterparts, why automakers have still struggled to replicate Tesla’s success and what is needed to sell them now.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:28 Chapter 1: From green to mean \n5:15 Chapter 2: How we got here \n8:12 Chapter 3: Declining sales \n12:05 Chapter 4: What's next \n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Nic Golden Henry\nCamera: Sean Baldwin, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato, Mallory Brangan\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Alex Roy, Audi, BMW, Ford, Getty Images, GM, Hyundai Motor Group, Nissan, Rimac, Rivian, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
