As the White House Press Secretary and Senior Adviser to the president she spent her last few months battling questions about President Joe Biden’s mental and physical capabilities to do the job. Now she’s left the Democratic Party, saying that they unleashed a “firing squad” on Biden and forced him out of the 2024 presidential race. \n\nJustin speaks to her about her book ‘Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House Outside the Party Lines’, why she thinks the Democratic Party has lost its fight and her belief that the party are abandoning LGBTQ issues and migrants in their attempt to fight back against Republicans.",

And the latest example of so-called nuclear 'sabre-rattling' by Vladimir Putin, forced Donald Trump to respond with a vague commitment of his own to resume US nuclear testing for the first time in decades.\n \nOn this edition of Ukrainecast, Jamie Coomarasamy and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined by BBC Verify's Olga Robinson and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi, to answer your questions. Could Denmark and Sweden police the Baltic Sea? What happened to the Russian dam targeted by Ukraine? And are Russians facing discrimination from authorities in Europe?",
