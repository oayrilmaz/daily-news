        "description": "After the search for survivors and recovery of victims in tragic aviation accidents — like that of a UPS cargo plane shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky last month — comes the search for flight data and a cockpit voice recorder often called the &quot;black box.&quot;\nEvery commercial plane has them. Aerospace giants GE Aerospace and Honeywell are among a few companies that design them to be nearly indestructible so they can help investigators understand the cause of a crash.\n\nA crash can cost airlines or plane manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars and leave victims' families with a lifetime of grief. And this crucial data can also help prevent future accidents. But in some circumstances black boxes were destroyed or never found.\n\nExperts say further developments such as cockpit video recorders and real-time data streaming are needed. CNBC explores the evolution of black box recorders.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - 1:49 Introduction \n1:50 - 5:36 From aluminum foil to chips\n5:37 - 9:50 How black boxes work\n9:51 - 13:40 The future of flight data recorders\n\nProduced and Edited by: Erin Black\nAnimations by: Emily Park, Jason Reginato\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Reporting: Leslie Josephs\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
