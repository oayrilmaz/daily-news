The cuts were expected to hit hundreds of thousands of travelers with little notice. Aviation analytics firm Cirium estimated the reductions would cancel up to 1,800 flights and cut 268,000 airline seats a day in the U.S. International flights are not affected. \n\n#us #governmentshutdown #deanduffy #airtravel #flights #shutdown #usairports #aviation #FAA #live #Reuters #News\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/",
