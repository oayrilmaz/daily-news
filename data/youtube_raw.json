Despite industry-leading range, cutting-edge technology and luxury finishes, the Lucid Air has fallen short of sales expectations. After posting a nearly $1 billion net loss last quarter, pressure is mounting for its new Gravity SUV to help turn the business around. But a year of supply-chain disruptions and production challenges has slowed Lucid’s ability to scale its three-row SUV. The company says the worst is behind it, even as it pushes into robotaxis through a partnership with Uber and autonomous tech startup Nuro — a deal that brought a $300 million investment and a commitment to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles. CNBC's Robert Ferris gets exclusive access inside Lucid’s Arizona factory and speaks with interim CEO Mark Winterhoff about how the EV-maker plans to change its fortunes.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:54 - Chapter 1.

        "description": "The United States Coast Guard is in &quot;active pursuit&quot; of an oil tanker sailing in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, according to US officials.   It follows the seizure of two other tankers by the US in recent days. \n\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered a &quot;blockade&quot; of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country, accusing Venezuela of using oil revenue to fund drug-related crime and terrorism.\n\nA US official said the latest ship being targeted was part of a &quot;sanctioned dark fleet that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion” and said it is “flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.&quot;\n\nVenezuela has described the seizures as theft, kidnapping and piracy and accuses the Trump administration of seeking to overthrow its president Nicolas Maduro. \n\nIn recent weeks the US has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, with growing speculation that the Trump administration could launch a direct military attack on Venezuela.   \n\nThe US has also been carrying out a series of air strikes on boats it accuses of smuggling drugs from Venezuela, killing around 100 people. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Joe Inwood. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
