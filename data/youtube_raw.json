Thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding an end to Iran's fundamentalist regime.\n\nThe United States has issued an urgent warning to its citizens to leave Iran immediately, as President Trump weighs up military and other options.  He has warned Iran’s leaders and security forces that they will “pay a big price” for the bloodshed and has urged Iran’s citizens to “keep protesting”.\n\nThe protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living.  They quickly widened into demands for political change and have become one of the most serious challenges to Iran’s clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lyse Doucet and Sarah Smith. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
