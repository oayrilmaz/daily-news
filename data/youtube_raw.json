Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s schedule was predictable: a regular commute in Queens between his law office and his home, along with visits to a gym and a cafe. For the men who began tailing him in the spring of 2023, getting a sense of his routine was easy. It helped, too, that Pannun was easy to spot, in his mid-50s, with a thick gray beard and an ink-black turban, marks of his Sikh faith. From a short distance away, the surveillance team took photos of him walking out of his house, entering his car, cooling down after a workout.\n\nHalf a world away from New York, Nikhil Gupta was waiting eagerly. Gupta was a medium-time New Delhi hustler with links to the drug trade, according to legal filings, who for several weeks had been in regular contact with an officer from India’s main foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW. Federal prosecutors allege that the spy had offered a deal: He would make a criminal case against Gupta go away, if Gupta helped to resolve a delicate matter overseas. “Nobody will ever bother you again,” the officer promised. Now, Gupta was attempting to fulfill his end of the bargain.\n\nRead the full inside story of how two alleged murder plots brought India, the US and Canada to a diplomatic crisis: URL\n\nWatch more short documentaries from Bloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq4LnWs3olUDhww8NEcViirkrirzHp27\n\n#India #Sikh #Documentary\n\n--------\nLike this video?
