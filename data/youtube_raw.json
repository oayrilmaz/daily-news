        "description": "Donald Trump has warned Iran that &quot;time is running out&quot; to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.\n \nThe US president said a &quot;massive Armada&quot; was &quot;moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose&quot; towards Iran, referring to a large US naval force.\n \nIn response, Iran's mission to the UN said Tehran &quot;stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests&quot;, but if pushed, it wrote in all capitals, it would defend itself and &quot;respond like never before&quot;.\n \nIran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\n \nTrump's latest warning to Iran's leaders follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on demonstrations in the country earlier this month.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Iran #DonaldTrump #BBCNews",
