She described Maduro and his wife as heroes and said she took the oath of office with pain because of the suffering caused by &quot;illegitimate military aggression”.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has been holding an emergency debate on the US operation. The UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was &quot;deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected”.   Iran and China both called for Maduro's immediate release with China's foreign ministry accusing the US of &quot;a clear violation of international law”.\n\nShares in some US oil companies have risen sharply, after the Trump administration made clear that it plans to control Venezuela's oil industry.\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Orla Guerin, Simon Jack, Chris Mason and Jeremy Bowen.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
