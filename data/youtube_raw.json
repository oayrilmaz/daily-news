        "description": "A landmark social media addiction trial in which top tech executives are expected to testify begins on Tuesday in California.\n \nThe plaintiff, a 19-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of the platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.\n \nThe defendants include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - TikTok's owner ByteDance and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled their case with the plaintiff last week. \n \nThe closely-watched case at Los Angeles Superior Court is the first in a wave of such lawsuits, which could challenge a legal theory used by tech firms to shield themselves from culpability in the US.\n \nMeta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online, and the companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#SocialMedia #Meta #ByteDance #Google #US #BBCNews",

        "description": "Following the fatal shooting of a second US citizen in Minneapolis on Saturday, the Trump administration is coming under increasing pressure over the tactics being used by federal agents, as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration.\n \nCritics across the political divide have been questioning the use of force in current operations, including Republican senators who have joined opposition Democrats in calls for a wide-ranging investigation into the incident.\n \nPresident Donald Trump says his administration is &quot;reviewing everything&quot; and is sending his border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to direct law-enforcement efforts there. \n \nThe White House says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and agents rank among the world’s most skilled and undergo rigorous training before going out into the field.\n \nSo who are the federal agents involved, and how far do their powers go?\n \nThe BBC’s correspondent in Washington Bernd Debusmann tells us more.\n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\n#BBCNews",
