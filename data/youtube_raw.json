Despite industry-leading range, cutting-edge technology and luxury finishes, the Lucid Air has fallen short of sales expectations. After posting a nearly $1 billion net loss last quarter, pressure is mounting for its new Gravity SUV to help turn the business around. But a year of supply-chain disruptions and production challenges has slowed Lucid’s ability to scale its three-row SUV. The company says the worst is behind it, even as it pushes into robotaxis through a partnership with Uber and autonomous tech startup Nuro — a deal that brought a $300 million investment and a commitment to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles. CNBC's Robert Ferris gets exclusive access inside Lucid’s Arizona factory and speaks with interim CEO Marc Winterhoff about how the EV-maker plans to change its fortunes.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:54 - Chapter 1.
