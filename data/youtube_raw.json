        "description": "Many Americans struggle to make ends meet even with two incomes but it wasn’t always this way. For a lot of the 20th century, a single income could support a middle-class lifestyle for certain workers. Historians and economists have traced the rise of dual-income households to long-term shifts in the U.S. economy. The majority of six-figure earners say living on one income feels nearly impossible, according to a recent Harris Poll. Meanwhile, Bank of America Institute data shows 26% of U.S. households spend more than 90% of their income on basic needs. While rising costs for childcare, housing, and education are part of the equation, historians and economists point to deeper structural changes in the labor market, including wage stagnation and the expansion of gig and temporary work, as key forces reshaping what it takes to afford a middle-class lifestyle. Watch the video above to learn more about how economic change has redefined what it takes to support a family today.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:52 Worker protections\n3:25 The rise of insecure work\n7:01 Today’s household math\n\nProduced by Charlotte Morabito\nEdited by Andrea Miller\nAnimation Jason Reginato, Emily Park, Mithra Krishnan\nSenior Director of Video Lindsey Jacobson\nAdditional Footage Getty Images\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "In Marseille, locals talk of a state of panic and terror gripping the city. Rival drug gangs are now using automatic weapons in their turf wars - and using teenagers too. \n \nThe number of children involved has risen sixfold in recent years. Many are forced into debt, beaten and threatened. \n \nThe city’s prosecutor called it a kind of slavery. Among the latest gang-related deaths, a fifteen year old boy was shot in the head and set on fire. \n \nFrench police are carrying out what they call “bombardments” of certain areas, trying to drive the dealers out. But the trade is being amplified on social media – where drugs and gang jobs are routinely advertised. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#France #Crime #BBCNews",

        "description": "England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is &quot;extremely worried&quot; about rising numbers of flu patients in hospitals and forthcoming strikes by resident doctors in England next week.\n\nSpeaking to LBC, Streeting said the current situation was &quot;probably the worst pressure the NHS has faced since Covid&quot;.\n\nFlu has come early this winter and it looks to be a particularly nasty season because of a new mutated version of the virus which is circulating, say experts. Many are now calling it &quot;super flu&quot;, but it is not more severe or harder to treat.\n\nA five-day strike by resident doctors in England, the new name for junior doctors, is set to begin on 17 December, but there are hopes it could be called off. The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, has agreed to poll its members to see if they are willing to call off the walkout.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Flu #NHS #England #BBCNews",
