        "description": "A US judge has dismissed a criminal case against Boeing over two crashes which killed 346 people.\n \nThe move came following a request from the US Department of Justice, but the judge harshly criticised the decision, saying the government had failed to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public.  \n \nBoth crashes were blamed on the flawed design of one of its flight control systems. \n \nThe Justice Department originally agreed a deal with Boeing to avoid prosecution in 2021 over allegations they had hid the problem - but said in May 2024 it had violated that agreement.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
