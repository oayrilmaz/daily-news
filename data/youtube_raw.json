        "description": "In the last week, Volodymyr Zelensky failed to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles from Donald Trump during a reportendly heated meeting. Then, a planned summit in Budapest between the US and Russian presidents was called off by Trump who said it would have been a ‘waste of time’.  \n\nBut, the White House has now increased the pressure on the Kremlin announcing sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, a first for the Trump administration since his return to office. But will these sanctions be enough to push Putin to the negotiating table? Or will the Kremlin see them as an escalation?   \n\nAnd as European leaders join Zelensky in insisting that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line, how should we interpret the Ukrainian leader's language?  \n\nTo answer your questions, Lucy and Vitaly are joined by the BBC’s Europe Digital Editor Paul Kirby and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi. \n\nThe team also discuss the EU’s plan for using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine and what, if anything, Ukraine is doing to combat propaganda within Russia.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
