Its forces are believed to have surrounded the key strategic cities of Pokrovsk and nearby Myrnohrad in the Donetsk region.\n \nThe cities are strategically important.  If they fall it will open the way for Russian forces to advance north and west.   Moscow says its forces have cut off Ukraine troops and there is street fighting in central areas. \n \nIt comes as US diplomats meet Ukrainian officials in Geneva to discuss Washington’s 28-point peace plan to end the war.\n \nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Abdujalil Abdurusalov in eastern Ukraine, Jonathan Beale in Kyiv and Steven Rosenberg in Moscow. \n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

And a US official tells the BBC there’s optimism - and momentum, as he put it.\n \nBut what’s on the table is a 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine that reflects Russia’s key demands. Everything from Ukraine abandoning hard-defended land, to a ban on joining Nato.\n \nAnd US President Donald Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday to sign up.\n \nMet with dismay in Ukraine, the deal’s controversial even in the US - where Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to confirm that this is in fact a US proposal, and not one written by the Kremlin.\n \nRubio is here today, as are officials from the European Union and UK anxious to ensure that if this is a starting point for a lasting peace deal - a big if - then Ukraine’s voice, and those of all its allies, must be heard.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
