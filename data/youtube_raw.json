Nowhere was that more on display than the summer of 2024 when an 81-year-old Democratic President Joe Biden limped through his debate with Trump, weeks before dropping out of the race in part due to pressure from fellow Democrats, including Pelosi.\n\n#pelosi  #politics  #unitedstates  #trump  #democrats \n\nRead the story here: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nancy-pelosi-first-woman-serve-us-house-speaker-retire-congress-2025-11-06/\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en",
