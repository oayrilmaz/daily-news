        "description": "The White House has made its first comments since US President Donald Trump sparked a row by saying that NATO troops had stayed “a little back” off the front lines during the war in Afghanistan.\n \nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the words were &quot;insulting and frankly appalling”.\n \nPrince Harry, who served in Afghanistan, has called for the sacrifices of Nato soldiers to be &quot;spoken about truthfully and with respect&quot;.\n \nThe White House's deputy press secretary said that Trump was right to have stressed that America's contribution to NATO dwarf those of other countries. There was no direct response to the outrage caused. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#US #Nato #BBCNews",

Can President Donald Trump's negotiating team curb the Kremlin's land-grabbing objectives? And what do the Ukrainian people make of all this, as they face air strikes and power outages, amid freezing temperatures?\n\nThe BBC's correspondent Wyre Davies spoke to us while on the road in Eastern Europe.\n\nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcastSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #BBCNews",

        "title": "Are ICE immigration agents acting outside the law? | BBC Americast",
        "description": "Donald Trump came into power with a promise to carry out the “largest mass deportation programme in history”. \n\nOne year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\n\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \n\nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.\n\nAnti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \n\nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \n\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \n\nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
