        "description": "Eli Weinstein is a convicted fraudster who stole millions of dollars from investors at the height of the pandemic. He was able to do so because President Donald Trump during his first term commuted his 24-year sentence for a previous conviction. Now Weinstein is said to be planning to ask Trump for clemency again.\n\nWithin months of his release in 2021, Weinstein returned to scamming, stealing from unsuspecting victims until he was caught and convicted again, this time sentenced to 37 years in prison. While the administration contends it carefully weighs all petitions, the case points up what critics argue is a radical new system of how presidential clemency is granted, one where financial resources, connections and politics govern who goes free and who does not. \n\nLearn more: Freed by Trump, a $200 Million Fraudster Started a New Scam - https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-eli-weinstein-ponzi-fraud/?srnd=phx-bigtake\n\n0:00 The cost of clemency\n1:37 The deal\n3:04 Eli Weinstein’s second chance\n4:45 Doing something good for the world\n5:42 The puppet master\n7:26 The brink of destruction\n10:52 The story isn’t over\n13:34 The purpose of clemency\n15:31 The system\n17:08 Out of chances?\n\nHelp shape the future of Bloomberg Video.

But with a shortage of talent, antiquated operating procedures and outdated facilities the industry — essential to U.S. energy security and defense — is in crisis. China dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry accounting for 53% of global market share followed by South Korea and Japan. The U.S. accounts for about 0.1%. But that could soon change. In southern Philadelphia, $5 billion is being invested by South Korean shipping conglomerate Hanwha. It hopes to turn this decades old shipyard into a state of the art facility.

        "description": "CNBC Marathon investigates the intricate, high-stakes world of semiconductor manufacturing from the Dutch labs powering AI chip breakthroughs to the billion-dollar fabs reshaping U.S. industry.\nIn a highly secured lab in the Netherlands, ASML spent a decade developing a $400 million machine that’s transforming how microchips are made. High NA is the latest generation of EUV, the only machines in the world that can etch nanoscopic blueprints on advanced chips for giants like Intel, TSMC and Samsung. The size of a double-decker bus, only five of these machines have been shipped so far. It’s unclear how Trump’s tariffs will impact the complex global supply chain for the lithography machines. But without them, no advanced chips can be made by the likes of Nvidia, Apple and AMD. No filming of High NA has ever been allowed until CNBC went to the Netherlands for this exclusive first look.\n\nTexas Instruments is building a $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject where Apple vows to make &quot;critical foundation semiconductors&quot; for iPhones and other devices. CNBC went to Sherman, Texas, for an exclusive first look inside the newest fab of seven TI's building in Utah and Texas to provide U.S.-made chips to customers like Nvidia and Ford. TI shares have suffered amid tariff concerns, and it's lost analog market share for several years, but top leaders are confident about the huge spend.\n\niPhone Air was the big star unveiled by Apple in early September but inside was another hardware set launched that day: three new custom Apple microchips. Apple’s A19 Pro SoC prioritizes AI workloads with neural accelerators added to the GPU cores. Replacing Broadcom and Qualcomm parts is the N1 and C1X, Apple’s first iPhone networking chip and second-generation iPhone modem. CNBC sat down with three Apple executives for the first U.S. interviews about its move to control all core iPhone chips.\n\nThis CNBC Marathon looks at the global race to build AI chips and how Apple is using the chips.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:00: How ASML Makes Chips Faster With Its New $400 Million High NA Machine (Published May 2025)\n18:09: Why Texas Instruments Is Betting $60 Billion On Making Cheap Chips In The U.S. (Published August 2025)\n33:48: How Apple’s New iPhone Chips Enable On-Device AI (Published September 2025)\n\nProduced by: Katie Tarasov\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller, Mike Heffron\nAdditional Camera: Magdalena Petrova, Andrew Evers, Graham Merwin\nAnimation: Jason Reginato, Mithra Krishnan, Emily Park\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Editing: Isabel Iino\nAdditional Footage: TSML, Intel, Getty Images, TSMC, Zeiss, Texas Instruments, KTEN, Samsung, Nvidia, Qualcomm\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
