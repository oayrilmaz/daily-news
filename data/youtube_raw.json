        "description": "A major row has erupted between the US defense department and the journalists that cover its work after a memo was issued last month requiring journalists to accept a new set of reporting restrictions or face being barred from America’s military headquarters.  \n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s new policy would require journalists to sign an agreement stating they will only publish information “explicitly authorised” by the defense department. News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting the restrictions, prompting a major walkout from the Pentagon as journalists from all but one news organisation handed in their press passes. \n\nThe move reignites the Trump administration’s long-running feud with the press and its freedom to report on the White House. In today’s episode, we look at why the memo has been issued, and implications for freedom of the press and future reporting.   \n\nAnd, we speak to Newsmax’s James Rosen about why his news organisation refused to sign up to the new rules and the impact on wider reporting of the Trump administration.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #presidenttrump",
