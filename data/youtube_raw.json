        "description": "Voting starts on Saturday for one of America’s biggest and most prominent political positions. \n\nHow did Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, emerge as the frontrunner to be the next mayor of New York, despite being virtually unknown at the start of his campaign?   \n\nSarah, Justin and Anthony look in more detail at his policies, and in particular the centrepiece of his campaign around the cost of living. Mamdani says he will make New York more affordable, by increasing housing stock, raising taxes for the rich and bringing down the cost of rent. How realistic are his promises and how much could it matter if he can’t deliver? We also unpack his views on Israel and Gaza, and how his views on Gaza could affect the Jewish vote in New York, the biggest outside of Israel.   \n\nWe get an inside track on Mamdani’s campaign from Eric Lach, staff writer at the New Yorker, who has been following him on the campaign trail, from before he won the primaries, to having dinner at Mamdani’s apartment in Queens. He also shares his views on how Mamdani will handle the NYPD, the country’s largest police department, after calling for the police to be defunded in 2020.  \n\nDonald Trump has made clear he thinks Mamdani is a radical left communist, so how might he handle the US president if he is elected as mayor? And how might Donald Trump target New York in return?  \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "title": "Has President Trump lost patience with Putin as he sanctions Russian oil companies? |BBC Ukrainecast",
        "description": "In the last week, Volodymyr Zelensky failed to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles from Donald Trump during a reportendly heated meeting. Then, a planned summit in Budapest between the US and Russian presidents was called off by Trump who said it would have been a ‘waste of time’.  \n\nBut, the White House has now increased the pressure on the Kremlin announcing sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, a first for the Trump administration since his return to office. But will these sanctions be enough to push Putin to the negotiating table? Or will the Kremlin see them as an escalation?   \n\nAnd as European leaders join Zelensky in insisting that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line, how should we interpret the Ukrainian leader's language?  \n\nTo answer your questions, Lucy and Vitaly are joined by the BBC’s Europe Digital Editor Paul Kirby and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi. \n\nThe team also discuss the EU’s plan for using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine and what, if anything, Ukraine is doing to combat propaganda within Russia.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
