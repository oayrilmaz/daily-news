Despite industry-leading range, cutting-edge technology and luxury finishes, the Lucid Air has fallen short of sales expectations. After posting a nearly $1 billion net loss last quarter, pressure is mounting for its new Gravity SUV to help turn the business around. But a year of supply-chain disruptions and production challenges has slowed Lucid’s ability to scale its three-row SUV. The company says the worst is behind it, even as it pushes into robotaxis through a partnership with Uber and autonomous tech startup Nuro — a deal that brought a $300 million investment and a commitment to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles.

It seized control of the country in a coup in February 2021 and since then Myanmar has been plunged into a civil war with rebel groups trying to overthrow the junta. \n \nThe BBC’s Yogita Limaye, Sanjay Ganguly and Aamir Peerzada gained exclusive access to civilians and rebel fighters ahead of the election.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
