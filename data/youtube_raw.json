        "description": "CNBC Marathon breaks down the key challenges facing the U.S. labor force as Americans become increasingly anxious about retirement savings, job security and economic uncertainty.\n\nMore than 60% of surveyed Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying, according to a 2025 survey from Allianz Life. Younger Americans are saving more than previous generations, yet they remain deeply pessimistic about retirement. As Social Security faces long-term funding issues and employer pensions fade away, many are depending on working longer to make ends meet. But some economists warn that planning to extend careers may not be a reliable solution considering the prevalence of age discrimination and the overall state of the labor market.\n\nRelatively few people are finding new jobs in the United States. The slowdown in hiring comes as businesses navigate rapidly evolving federal policies on taxes, trade and immigration. In the backdrop, younger people are struggling to find work in software development and marketing roles that may be augmented or replaced by artificial intelligence. The Federal Reserve cut short-term lending rates to support economic growth despite higher than ideal inflation.\n\nThe U.S. labor market is showing signs of stagnation. People are quitting their jobs at the lowest rate in recent years and companies are hiring at their slowest pace in more than a decade. Now, employees are opting to stay in jobs that may not be fulfilling. Experts say fears of inflation, layoffs and a cooling economy are driving this trend, which could potentially dampen innovation and hurt long-term economic growth.\n\nAmericans are worried about their careers. This CNBC Marathon delves into why young workers are questioning the reliability of the U.S. retirement system, how a stagnating work force is slowing hiring and what that means for Americans staying at jobs they may otherwise would quit if not for the current economic trends.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:45 Why Your Retirement Plan Might Backfire (Published August 2025)\n13:25 Why Jobs Are Disappearing In The U.S. (Published September 2025)\n22:12 Why So Many Americans Are Clinging To Their Jobs (Published September 2025)\n\nCredits:\nProduced by: Charlotte Morabito, Carlos Waters\nEdited by: Nora Rappaport, Andrea Miller\nAdditional Editing by: Jeff Huang\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato, Andrea Schmitz\nAdditional Camera by: Kaan Oguz\nSenior Director of Video: Lindsey Jacobson\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images\nAdditional Sources: ADP, Bankrate, Fannie Mae, Fidelity, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Stanford University, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Treasury Department\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "CNBC Marathon looks at how Gen Z is reinvigorating legacy brands and influencing change in fashion and beauty retail.\n\nAfter a severe slump in the 2010s, Coach engineered a comeback by winning over Gen Z. In 2024, Coach surpassed Michael Kors to capture 2nd place in the U.S. luxury handbag market, according to Bernstein. In its third fiscal quarter of 2025, more than two-thirds of the brand’s nearly 900,000 new customers in North America were Gen Z and millennials. And, its success has boosted its parent company, Tapestry.\n\nDefining fashion for decades, Gap reached nearly 3,000 stores worldwide by 2001. But, in the decades that followed, the apparel retailer lost its brand identity, experienced declining sales and closed hundreds of stores. Now, revitalized marketing efforts from CEO Richard Dickson, and new creative direction from fashion designer Zac Posen, has brought the brand back into the cultural relevance.\n\nAffordable cosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty posted its first billion-dollar fiscal year in 2024 and announced its blockbuster acquisition of Hailey Bieber's Rhode in a $1 billion deal within a year. The deal will bring the company into more premium channels after being in drugstores, Target, Walmart, Dollar General and Ulta. But, Wall Street has been weary as of late with shares dropping more than 10% the day after posting its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings results. The company posted a 30% drop in profits during the quarter.\n\nCoach, Gap and e.l.f. Beauty are among the companies benefiting from Gen Z’s influence and Wall Street is watching. This CNBC Marathon delves into how Coach is winning over younger shoppers, the details of Gap’s comeback strategy and how e.l.f. Beauty has cornered the dupes marketplace.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:25 Why Gen Z Fell In Love With Coach\n10:45 How Gap Is Making A Comeback\n20:45 Is The $1B Hailey Bieber Deal Enough To Keep E.l.f.
