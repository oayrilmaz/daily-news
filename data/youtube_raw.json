Witnesses say most were killed by Israeli forces.\n \nIsrael has regularly denied that its troops fired on civilians at or near the sites and the GHF has maintained that aid distribution at its sites has been carried out &quot;without incident&quot;.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#GHF #BBCNews",

I may.&quot;\n \nBut asked about the same prospect after a call with Putin, Trump said &quot;we can't deplete&quot; the US stockpile of Tomahawks, adding &quot;we need them too... so I don't know what we can do about that&quot;.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Tomahawk #Ukraine #BBCNews",
