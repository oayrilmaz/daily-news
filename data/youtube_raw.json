        "description": "Ukraine says a &quot;common understanding&quot; has been reached with the US on  a peace deal aimed at ending the war with Russia.\n\nThe proposal is based on a 28-point plan presented to Ukraine by the US last week.\n\nIn a post on social media, US President Donald Trump said the original plan had been fine-tuned and “a deal may be close”.   He’s sending his special envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow discuss the plan with Russia’s President Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said earlier that Russia had not yet been consulted on the new draft deal and warned that it might not accept amendments to the original plan.\n\nSome of the key issues which divide Russia and Ukraine are reported to remain unaddressed so far – including security guarantees for Ukraine and control of several regions in the east of the country.\n\nEuropean leaders have expressed scepticism that peace could be in reach.  The French President Emmanuel Macron said he saw &quot;no Russian will for a ceasefire&quot; while the UK warned there was still “a long way to go.&quot;\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by James Waterhouse in Kyiv,  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow and Sarah Smith in Washington. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
