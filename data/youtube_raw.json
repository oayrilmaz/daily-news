The shutdown follows the discovery in Gaza of the body of the last remaining hostage, which was announced by the Israeli military on January 26. Ran Gvili, 24, was an off-duty police officer recovering from an injury, who was killed fighting militants that had infiltrated Israel during the 2023 attack.\n \n#israel #telaviv #hostages #middleeast #news\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: [https://www.reuters.com/](https://www.reuters.com/)",

        "description": "A landmark social media addiction trial in which top tech executives are expected to testify begins on Tuesday in California.\n \nThe plaintiff, a 19-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of the platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.\n \nThe defendants include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - TikTok's owner ByteDance and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled their case with the plaintiff last week. \n \nThe closely-watched case at Los Angeles Superior Court is the first in a wave of such lawsuits, which could challenge a legal theory used by tech firms to shield themselves from culpability in the US.\n \nMeta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online, and the companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#SocialMedia #Meta #ByteDance #Google #US #BBCNews",
