        "description": "CNBC Marathon looks at how Gen Z is reinvigorating legacy brands and influencing change in fashion and beauty retail.\n\nAfter a severe slump in the 2010s, Coach engineered a comeback by winning over Gen Z. In 2024, Coach surpassed Michael Kors to capture 2nd place in the U.S. luxury handbag market, according to Bernstein. In its third fiscal quarter of 2025, more than two-thirds of the brand’s nearly 900,000 new customers in North America were Gen Z and millennials. And, its success has boosted its parent company, Tapestry.\n\nDefining fashion for decades, Gap reached nearly 3,000 stores worldwide by 2001. But, in the decades that followed, the apparel retailer lost its brand identity, experienced declining sales and closed hundreds of stores. Now, revitalized marketing efforts from CEO Richard Dickson, and new creative direction from fashion designer Zac Posen, has brought the brand back into the cultural relevance.\n\nAffordable cosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty posted its first billion-dollar fiscal year in 2024 and announced its blockbuster acquisition of Hailey Bieber's Rhode in a $1 billion deal within a year. The deal will bring the company into more premium channels after being in drugstores, Target, Walmart, Dollar General and Ulta. But, Wall Street has been weary as of late with shares dropping more than 10% the day after posting its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings results. The company posted a 30% drop in profits during the quarter.\n\nCoach, Gap and e.l.f. Beauty are among the companies benefiting from Gen Z’s influence and Wall Street is watching. This CNBC Marathon delves into how Coach is winning over younger shoppers, the details of Gap’s comeback strategy and how e.l.f. Beauty has cornered the dupes marketplace.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:25 Why Gen Z Fell In Love With Coach\n10:45 How Gap Is Making A Comeback\n20:45 Is The $1B Hailey Bieber Deal Enough To Keep E.l.f.

        "description": "China is holding military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against &quot;separatist forces&quot;.\n \nThe army, navy, air force and rocket force have been dispatched for the drills which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said.\n \nCodenamed &quot;Justice Mission 2025&quot;, the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms.\n \nWhile some initial drills have begun, the military said it would conduct a major exercise from 08:00 to 18:00 local time on Tuesday.\n \nTaiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#China #Taiwan #BBCNews",

        "description": "Donald Trump and Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky have described their latest meeting in Florida as “terrific” and said significant progress had been made.  President Trump said a peace deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine was “very close”. \n\nSpeaking after the meeting, President Zelensky said the 20-point peace plan was 90% agreed, while Donald Trump said a security guarantee was “close to 95%” done.  Zelensky said that was a “key milestone in achieving a lasting peace” in Ukraine.\n\nHowever the US President also said “one or two very thorny issues” remained to be settled.   These include the future of Ukraine’s Donbas region, which Russia’s President Putin has laid claim to.    Trump confirmed that issue was unresolved although he said agreement was getting closer.\n\nNotably, Trump and Zelensky did not offer any timelines, instead vowing to have their teams meet again in the coming weeks.\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sean Dilley in Washington and Samira Hussain in Kyiv.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
