        "title": "Is Canada leading the global resistance against Trump? | The Global Story Podcast",
        "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney seemed to challenge Donald Trump in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, declaring that “the old world order is not coming back” and urging fellow “middle powers” to come together. \n\nIn response, Trump said Canada gets “a lot of freebies” from the United States and “they should be grateful”.   \n\nAfter striking a major trade and tariff deal with China – the US’s rival superpower – is Carney emerging as the leader of a global resistance to Trump? And does he have an alternative vision for the world? \n\nTristan Redman and Asma Khalid speak to Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s chief international correspondent.  \n\nNew episodes of The Global Story are released daily. If you’re in the UK, listen on BBC Sounds.
