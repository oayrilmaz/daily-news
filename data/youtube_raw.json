        "description": "Driving instructors are being offered kickbacks of up to £250 a month to sell their official test-booking login details to touts, a BBC investigation has found.\n \nTouts use these login details to book driving tests in bulk and sell them to learners on WhatsApp and Facebook, charging as much as £500 for tests that should cost no more than £75. \n \nThis makes it harder for learners to book through legitimate routes and adds to already lengthy waiting times.\n \nThe BBC confronted Anil Ahmed, who buys driving instructors' login details and then sells tests online at a mark-up. He says the claims we put to him are a &quot;complete fabrication&quot;.\n \nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander recently announced plans to change driving test rules, which it is hoped will stop touts and reduce the backlog. Only learners - not instructors - will be able to book test slots from spring 2026. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#DrivingTest #UK #BBCNews",
