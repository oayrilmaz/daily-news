        "description": "Many Americans struggle to make ends meet even with two incomes but it wasn’t always this way. For a lot of the 20th century, a single income could support a middle-class lifestyle for certain workers. Historians and economists have traced the rise of dual-income households to long-term shifts in the U.S. economy. The majority of six-figure earners say living on one income feels nearly impossible, according to a recent Harris Poll. Meanwhile, Bank of America Institute data shows 26% of U.S. households spend more than 90% of their income on basic needs. While rising costs for childcare, housing, and education are part of the equation, historians and economists point to deeper structural changes in the labor market, including wage stagnation and the expansion of gig and temporary work, as key forces reshaping what it takes to afford a middle-class lifestyle.

The vote was widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and many nations view his rule as illegitimate.\n \nIn an exclusive interview with the BBC's Lucy Hockings, she said: &quot;Of course I'm going back [to Venezuela]. I know exactly the risks I'm taking.&quot;\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog \n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n \n#Venezuela #MariaCorinaMachado #BBCNews",
