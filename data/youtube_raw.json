        "description": "Gold’s price per ounce surged past $4,000 this month, a record-breaking rally tied in part to eroding confidence in the US dollar. Uncertainty driven by Donald Trump’s trade war as well as questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and America’s wavering economy have also played a part.
