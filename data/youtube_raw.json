Often it comes from unexpected places — like finding out your child has a rare disease that may kill her.\n\nLuke Rosen was working as an actor and writer in New York when his daughter Susannah was diagnosed with KIF1A, an ultra-rare neurodegenerative condition. It's often fatal. At the time they received Susannah's diagnosis, Luke and his wife Sally didn't have much hope. There was no treatment for KIF1A, and there wasn't much work being done on it among researchers.\nBut Luke, one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet, did what so many parents of children with rare diseases do...he threw himself at the problem.\n\nHe and Sally started the KIF1A.org Foundation so they could start building research that could go towards finding a treatment for their daughter. It was the beginning of a long journey for the family. Ultimately, that journey led them to the n-Lorem Foundation, an organization founded by CNBC Cures Advisory Board member Dr. Stan Crooke that offers free ASO treatments to individuals with nano-rare diseases. Thirty years in the making, Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology bridges genomic discovery to personalized medicine one patient at a time. Because of the work done by n-Lorem, Susannah is now receiving treatment for her KIF1A. Luke says the treatments helped for while, though he's now worried the disease is catching up.\n\nTo learn more about KIF1A-associated neurological disorders, please check out Luke and Susannah's foundation called KIF1A.org.\n\nn-Lorem's work is here: https://www.nlorem.org/\n\nChapters:\n00:30 Introduction\n03:05 Susannah's story\n11:15 Treating nano-rare patients\n19:53 Taking a risk\n27:06 Hope is the best medicine\n36:11 We're the lucky ones\n\nWatch Episode 1 of The Path: https://youtu.be/-SD8-YcQdb4\n\nJoin us in advancing awareness and understanding of rare diseases: https://www.cnbc.com/cures/\n\nTo share your story, email us: CNBC.cures@cnbc.com\n\nProduced by: Katie Kramer, Brad Quick, Kelly Lin, Leanne Miller\nEdited by: John Lazration\nCamera: Gerry Miller, David Grogan, Marco Mastrorilli, Tara McCurrie\nAudio: Everett Wong\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato, Lindsey Jacobson\nAdditional Material: Luke Rosen, n-Lorem Foundation, Ryan Christopher Jones\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/42d859g\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

And, as Washington throws its support behind the Syrian government, is this a sign that the US has abandoned the Kurds?\n \nNew episodes of the Global News Podcast are published twice a day.

        "description": "Ukraine saw a relatively quiet night after Donald Trump said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had agreed not to attack Kyiv and &quot;various towns&quot; during a cold snap.\n \nThe Kremlin confirmed it had agreed to cease attacks on Kyiv until Sunday to &quot;create favourable conditions&quot; for peace talks.\n \nWhile the US president did not say when the pause would begin, air raid alerts sounded in just eight Ukrainian regions overnight into Friday, with two minor injuries recorded in Zaporizhzhia.\n \nTemperatures in the capital, Kyiv, are due to plummet to -24C (-11F) over the coming days. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as it has during cold periods since its invasion began.\n \nUkrainian officials had been expecting a major attack this weekend ahead of the current cold spell - if that does not take place, it could mark a significant step in US-led efforts to bring the war to a close.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #BBCNews",
