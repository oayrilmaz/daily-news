        "description": "Daniela and Dario Amodei left OpenAI five years ago to form Anthropic, a company focused on AI safety and enterprise. Since then, the Claude creator's revenue has grown 10x annually for three straight years, with 85% coming from business customers — the inverse of OpenAI's consumer-heavy model. Daniela Amodei, the company's president and co-founder, has emerged as the operational counterweight to her brother Dario's technical vision. CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos interviews Daniela and other experts, and breaks down how Anthropic quietly rose to the top of the AI race.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n2:03 The beginning\n4:52 The enterprise bet\n9:39 Compute is destiny\n13:20 An identity defined by OpenAI\n16:18 What could go wrong\n\nReporting by: MacKenzie Sigalos\nEdited by: Erin Black\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nCamera: Newton Ward, Michael Crowe, Peter Cassam, Duane Poquis, Cary Patton\nAdditional Production: Andrew Evers, Laura Batchelor\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "The CNBC Housing Market Survey asks over 100 real estate agents about local market conditions and buy/seller sentiment. In the final quarter of 2025, real estate professionals saw prices remaining flat or falling in many parts of the country. Most homes sold by respondents stayed on the market for over 3 weeks – a signal for buyers who’ve delayed purchases as prices hover near record levels. As a result, a growing cohort of agents are reducing their asking prices for listings – or pulling them off the market entirely.\n\nProduced by: Lisa Rizzolo\nReported by: Diana Olick\nEditing and Graphics by: Carlos Waters\nSenior Managing Producer: Shawn Baldwin\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images, Heather Dell\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
