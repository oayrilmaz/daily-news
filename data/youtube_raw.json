However, investors are leaning toward larger-scale acquisitions and bigger, higher-quality assets. All transaction sizes dropped markedly in November, except those sales greater than $100 million, which were 51% higher year-over-year.

The second-largest sale of the month, totaling $615 million, involved three industrial properties.
