Transaction volume was 10% lower year-over-year in November 2025, with just 1,800 deals overall, according to monthly data provided by Moody's as a media exclusive to CNBC's Property Play. However, investors are leaning toward larger-scale acquisitions and bigger, higher-quality assets. All transaction sizes dropped markedly in November, except those sales greater than $100 million, which were 51% higher year-over-year. This pushed the average deal size in November to $14.2 million, compared with an average of $12 million since the start of 2019. The largest deal was a $7.2 billion medical office portfolio of 296 properties in 34 states was sold by Welltower to a joint venture of Remedy Medical Properties and Kayne Anderson Real Estate. The second-largest sale of the month, totaling $615 million, involved three industrial properties.

They would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached.\n\nLaura and Paddy are joined by chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman and The Sun on Sunday’s political editor Kate Ferguson to talk through what it all means, and what it might do to Keir Starmer’s ‘special relationship’ with Trump. \n\nThey also talk about why the news might be a bit awkward for Nigel Farage and his Reform Party.\n\n#BBCNews",
