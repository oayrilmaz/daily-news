Seven buildings are operating now, and once complete, the site will have around 30 buildings and consume some 2.2 gigawatts of power. CNBC went to the small town of New Carlisle, Indiana, to talk to locals who are worried about the impact on their community and electric bills - and to get a first ever on-camera tour inside what Amazon’s calling the largest cluster of non-Nvidia chips in the world. We also sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman and Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger for more details on the partnership.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n2:37 Rapid buildout\n6:41 Exclusively AWS chips\n9:41 Aligned with Anthropic\n12:24 Power and water\n\nProduced and Shot by: Katie Tarasov\nAdditional Reporting: MacKenzie Sigalos\nEdited by: Mike Heffron\nAdditional Camera: Erin Black, Michael Crowe, Newton Ward, Peter Cassam\nSenior Director of Video: Jeniece Pettitt\nAnimation: Emily Park, Jason Reginato, Josh Kalven\nAdditional Production: Laura Batchelor\nAdditional Footage: Amazon, Getty Images, Meta, Indiana Michigan Power, Last Energy\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
