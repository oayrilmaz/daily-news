        "title": "Donald Trump backtracks on using force over Greenland and drops new tariffs on allies | BBC News",
        "description": "Donald Trump has backed down over Greenland - ruling out his previous threats to seize the island by force - and withdrawing his plan to impose new tariffs on countries opposing his proposals. \n\nInstead the US President told world leaders meeting in Davos, Switzerland that he is seeking immediate negotiations to acquire the island.   He said: “We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be frankly unstoppable. But I won't do that.”\n\nHe also said is dropping plans to add a 10% tariff to goods from eight European countries over their opposition to his push to acquire Greenland. \n\nHis wide-ranging speech, in which he appeared to confuse Greenland with Iceland four times, lasted more than an hour.\n\nIn a post on social media Trump says he has “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland&quot; after talks with Nato's secretary general, Mark Rutte. \n\nUS markets rose sharply following the announcement.  The news offered some relief for the US's European allies, who had been facing the possibility of an armed stand-off with their NATO ally.   \n\nHowever President Trump's new position leaves many questions unanswered, with allies unclear on US policy towards Greenland going forward.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason and Katya Adler. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "When the White House announced the creation of a new international body, it was framed as part of the Gaza peace plan. \n\nBut US President Donald Trump appears to have much more wide-reaching ambitions for his Board of Peace. A leaked draft of the charter suggests it will have a broader purpose of resolving global conflicts. \n\nMany countries and world leaders have been invited to join, including China and Russia.\n\nIs this a new international body designed to challenge or replace the United Nations? And what power would it have?\n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
