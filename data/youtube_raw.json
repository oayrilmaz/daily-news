        "title": "Trump wants 'immediate negotiations' for Greenland but 'won't use force' | BBC News",
        "description": "US President Donald Trump says he is seeking immediate negotiations to acquire Greenland, which he called a &quot;vast, almost uninhabited and undeveloped country, sitting undefended&quot;.\n\nHe told world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland: &quot;We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be frankly unstoppable. But I won't do that&quot;\n\nThe US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-west - a facility it has operated since World War Two. \n\nUnder existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Trump #Greenland #BBCNews",
