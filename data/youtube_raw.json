        "description": "Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said this week that there are 170,000 Russian troops on the outskirts of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub in the Donetsk region which it has been targeting for more than a year. Meanwhile, on the diplomatic front, some analysts are pointing to Turkey’s apparent pivot away from Russian oil purchases as evidence that new US sanctions are beginning to bite.\n\nTo answer your questions, Lucy Hockings is joined in the Ukrainecast studio by the BBC’s Europe digital editor Paul Kirby and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi, as well as diplomatic correspondent James Landale from Kyiv. Could Ukraine develop its own nuclear weapons? Will a Swedish aircraft become a gamechanger? And would the seizure of frozen Russian assets held in Belgium really discourage external investment in Europe?",
