  "summary_md": "# PTD Today Forward Watchlist (Rest of 2026)  \n**(Based on headline signals from last 30 days feed)**\n\n---\n\n## 1) Themes to watch  \n- Offshore wind project developments and disputes (e.g., Orsted vs US regulatory halt, Apollo co-ownership of Hornsea 3)  \n- Solar PV market dynamics balancing capacity growth and supplier challenges (China price changes, India mandates, Bangladesh tenders)  \n- Grid flexibility and integration to support community solar and renewables (US state orders for flexible grid connections)  \n- AI and digital innovation impacting renewables and data center efficiency (digital twin for floating PV, AI economics, Intel fab scrutiny)  \n- Geopolitical tensions and risks impacting energy infrastructure security (subsea cable cut incident involving Russian crew)  \n- Domestic content and manufacturing policies shaping battery storage and PV supply chains (India’s 20% domestic content mandate)  \n\n---\n\n## 2) What to monitor next  \n\n### Grid / Renewables  \n- US regulatory environment and policy shifts affecting offshore wind (Orsted’s challenge to US project halt)  \n- Flexible grid connection policies for community solar deployment in US states  \n- UK solar’s Contract-for-Difference (CfD) pipeline and deployment trajectory in 2026  \n- India's expanding domestic content requirements in battery storage projects impacting supply chains  \n\n### Oil & Gas  \n- Not enough information in the headlines regarding oil & gas trends this period  \n\n### Data Centers & AI  \n- Adoption of AI-powered digital twins for floating PV optimization  \n- Intel's Arizona semiconductor fab situation and implications for chip supply chain  \n- Broader AI inference economics and trade viability over coming years  \n\n### Semiconductors  \n- Pricing signals from China wafer manufacturers that may influence module costs and semiconductor supply chain stress points  \n\n### Critical Minerals  \n- Not enough information in the headlines about rare earths or critical minerals explicitly  \n- Potential indirect impact from India’s battery storage content rules on critical mineral sourcing  \n\n---\n\n## 3) Regions / Companies Appearing Repeatedly  \n- China: Leading in offshore wind turbine capacity; solar manufacturer challenges; wafer/module pricing pressure  \n- US: Regulatory and market support for solar and community solar flexibility; Intel fab watch  \n- India: Major solar manufacturer Waaree Energies growth; domestic content rules  \n- UK: Strong solar CfD deployment expected  \n- Orsted (Denmark-based) in focus for offshore wind US project issues  \n- Apollo (US-based investor) increasing offshore wind ownership  \n- Finland and Russia implicated in subsea cable sabotage incident  \n\n---\n\n## 4) Constraints / Risks Implied by Headlines  \n- Regulatory and political obstacles impacting large-scale offshore wind projects (US vs Orsted)  \n- Solar supply chain uncertainties due to manufacturer exits, pricing shifts in China  \n- Energy infrastructure security threats from geopolitical actions (e.g., subsea cable sabotage)  \n- Potential penalties for utilities shifting to fixed charges risking efficiency and consumer backlash  \n- Market and operational risks tied to AI adoption and semiconductor fab performance outcomes  \n\n---\n\n*End of Forward Watchlist*"
