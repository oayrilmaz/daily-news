  "summary_md": "# PTD Today Forward Watchlist (Rest of Year • Headline Signals Last 30 Days)\n\n---\n\n## 1) Themes to Watch\n- Offshore wind projects facing regulatory and ownership changes (e.g., Orsted challenge, Apollo co-ownership of Hornsea 3)\n- Solar deployment growth and pricing pressure in China, US, UK, and India, including policy-driven domestic content rules\n- Data center and subsea cable vulnerability to geopolitical tensions (e.g., Finnish police seize ship suspected of cutting a subsea cable)\n- AI economics and applications in renewables (floating PV digital twins) and semiconductors highlighted by industry leaders\n- Oil & gas geopolitical risks linked to Venezuela impacting supply and US interests\n- Semiconductor manufacturing in flux with Intel’s Arizona fab and fluctuating module pricing in China\n\n---\n\n## 2) What to Monitor Next\n\n### Grid / Renewables\n- Effects of policy and regulatory challenges on offshore wind projects in the US and UK (Orsted, Hornsea 3)\n- UK solar CFDs and US solar market trajectory toward 737.8 GW by 2035, with pricing developments in China modules near CNY 1/W\n- India’s domestic content mandate in battery storage and expanding solar manufacturing capacity (Waaree Energies, Tata Power)\n\n### Oil & Gas\n- US strikes and political instability in Venezuela influencing oil supply security and geopolitical dynamics\n\n### Data Centers & AI\n- Security and operational risks to subsea cable infrastructure amid geopolitical conflicts (Finnish cable incident)\n- AI's evolving role in renewable energy management and semiconductor industry economics (Plexo Capital, Deepwater insights)\n\n### Semiconductors\n- Intel’s Arizona fab status and China's wafer pricing trends as indicators of chip supply chain and manufacturing resilience\n\n### Critical Minerals\n- Not enough information in the headlines to specify critical minerals signals\n\n---\n\n## 3) Regions / Companies Appearing Repeatedly\n- China: solar manufacturing, offshore wind single-unit capacity leadership\n- US: solar market expansion, AI economic insights, subsea cable geopolitical concerns\n- UK: solar CfD deployments, offshore wind projects (Hornsea 3)\n- India: solar manufacturing and battery storage domestic content mandates\n- Venezuela: oil-related geopolitics and US military actions\n- Companies: Orsted (offshore wind), Apollo (offshore wind co-owner), Intel (semiconductors), Waaree Energies & Tata Power (solar)\n\n---\n\n## 4) Constraints / Risks Implied by Headlines\n- US regulatory halts and opposition to offshore wind development projects (e.g., Orsted $5B project)\n- Potential exit of Chinese solar manufacturers from key projects indicating project or financing risks\n- Geopolitical instability (US-Venezuela conflict) impacting oil supply security and regional stability\n- Vulnerability of critical data infrastructure (subsea cables) to sabotage or geopolitical influence\n- Market and policy pressures on solar and battery industry pricing and domestic content requirements affecting supply chains\n\n---"
