  "summary_md": "# PTD Today Forward Watchlist (rest of year • headline signals from last 30 days)\n\n## 1) Themes to watch\n- Offshore wind project development and regulatory challenges, especially US-China-Europe dynamics.\n- Solar market expansion and pricing pressures, with emphasis on domestic content rules and manufacturing shifts.\n- AI and digital twin applications rising in energy and semiconductor sectors.\n- Semiconductor industry investment and operational risks in major US fabs.\n- Security threats to critical infrastructure (subsea cables) amid geopolitical tensions.\n- Utility business model shifts impacting efficiency and grid flexibility.\n\n## 2) What to monitor next\n\n### Grid / Transmission\n- Flexible grid connections mandated for community solar in US states.\n- Security risks highlighted by Finnish police seizing a ship suspected of damaging subsea cables.\n\n### Renewables\n- Orsted’s $5 billion offshore wind project halted by US, indicating regulatory/political hurdles.\n- China leads offshore wind turbine capacity; Vestas installs 15 MW units offshore.\n- UK solar forecasted for record CfD deployment in 2026.\n- India mandates 20% domestic content in battery storage projects.\n- Large-scale solar projects advancing in India (Waaree Energies 20+ GW ALMM approved) and Bangladesh (220 MW tender).\n- Solar module price trends in China targeting CNY 1/W mark.\n\n### Oil & Gas\n- Not enough information in the headlines.\n\n### Data Centers & AI\n- AI “inference economics” flagged as key trend by Plexo Capital.\n- Deepwater’s Doug Clinton sees AI trade continuing for several more years.\n- New digital twin using AI applied to floating PV installations.\n\n### Semiconductors\n- Intel Arizona fab’s fate described as uncertain, signaling operational/strategic pressure.\n- China wafer suppliers raising quotes affecting module prices.\n\n### Rare Earth / Critical Minerals\n- Not enough information from headlines on rare earths or minerals supply chain; but India domestic content rules in battery storage hint at strategic material sourcing focus.\n\n## 3) Regions / companies appearing repeatedly\n- Regions: US, China, UK, India, Bangladesh, Finland (subsea cable incident).\n- Companies: Orsted, Vestas, Tata Power Renewable, Waaree Energies, Apollo (offshore wind co-owner), Intel.\n\n## 4) Constraints/risks implied by headlines\n- Regulatory and political risks delaying or halting offshore wind projects (Orsted US halt).\n- Rising solar manufacturing costs due to wafer supplier price increases in China.\n- Potential project exits by key solar manufacturers (Eging in China).\n- Utility tariff design shifts may discourage efficiency due to fixed charge adoption.\n- Infrastructure vulnerability highlighted by subsea cable attack and geopolitical tensions (Russian crew detained).\n\n---\n\nThis watchlist aggregates operational, regulatory, and market signals from the past 30 days relevant to energy infrastructure, renewables, AI integration, semiconductor investments, and supply chain security."
