  "summary_md": "# PTD Today Forward Watchlist (Rest of Year • Headline Signals Last 30 Days)\n\n## 1) Themes to Watch\n- Offshore wind project developments and regulatory challenges in the US.\n- Record solar capacity goals and CfD deployments in the UK and India.\n- Solar manufacturing and module pricing shifts in China.\n- Emerging AI applications in energy digital twins and data center economics.\n- Subsea cable security risks and geopolitical tensions impacting data transmission.\n- Semiconductor manufacturing capacity and strategic significance of new fabs.\n\n## 2) What to Monitor Next\n\n### Grid / Transmission\n- Subsea cable vulnerability highlighted by Finnish police seizing ship for cutting cable.\n- US state mandates for utilities to enable flexible grid connections for community solar.\n\n### Renewables\n- Orsted’s legal challenge against US halt of $5 billion offshore wind project signals project and permitting scrutiny.\n- UK solar on track for record Contract for Difference (CfD) deployments in 2026.\n- India’s mandate of 20% domestic content in battery storage projects may impact supply chains and project timelines.\n- Bangladesh seeking contractors for a 220 MW solar project indicates regional solar expansion.\n- Tata Power Renewable’s completion of a 1 GW DCR-compliant PV project for SJVN underscores large-scale solar capacity growth.\n- China’s wafer price rise with 2026 module prices possibly hitting CNY 1/W could influence global solar PV costs.\n- Apollo’s co-ownership of Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm shows investor interest in large-scale wind assets.\n\n### Oil & Gas\n- US interest and strikes in Venezuela imply geopolitical risk impacting oil production and supply stability.\n\n### Data Centers & AI\n- AI’s evolving “inference economics” and digital twins for floating PV show AI’s growing role in energy optimization.\n- Semiconductor fab developments at Intel’s Arizona site underline chip manufacturing’s strategic importance linked to AI.\n\n### Critical Minerals / Rare Earths\n- Not enough information in the headlines about critical minerals or rare earth metal developments.\n\n## 3) Regions / Companies Appearing Repeatedly\n- US (offshore wind projects, solar market growth, subsea cable incidents, AI in energy).\n- China (solar manufacturing, wafer pricing).\n- UK (record solar CfD deployment).\n- India (battery storage policies, large-scale solar manufacturing).\n- Orsted (offshore wind legal challenge).\n- Apollo (ownership in Hornsea 3 wind farm).\n- Intel (Arizona semiconductor fab).\n\n## 4) Constraints / Risks Implied by Headlines\n- Regulatory and permit challenges potentially delaying or halting offshore wind projects (e.g. Orsted in US).\n- Geopolitical risks around Venezuela may affect oil supply and markets.\n- Supply chain and pricing pressures in solar PV modules due to rising wafer prices in China.\n- Grid integration challenges requiring regulatory and utility adaptation to increased community solar and renewables.\n- Physical security risks to subsea transmission infrastructure (cable cutting incident)."
