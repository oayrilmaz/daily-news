  "summary_md": "# PTD Today Forward Watchlist (Rest of Year • Headline Signals Last 30 Days)\n\n## 1) Themes to Watch\n- Offshore wind project regulatory and permitting challenges in the US (Orsted halted $5B project).\n- Accelerating solar deployments and record CfD tenders (UK, Bangladesh, Nepal, US market growth).\n- Increasing focus on domestic content requirements in renewable energy storage (India mandates 20% local content).\n- Semiconductor industry dynamics amid fab expansions and pricing pressures (Intel Arizona fab, China wafer price trends).\n- Emerging applications of AI and digital twins in renewables and data center operations.\n- Infrastructure security risks highlighted by subsea cable sabotage allegations (Finnish police detain Russian crew).\n\n## 2) What to Monitor Next\n\n### Grid / Renewables\n- Offshore wind policy and project approvals in the US; impact of Orsted’s stalled $5B offshore wind project.\n- Solar project pipelines and auction trends: UK solar CfD records, Bangladesh 220 MW projects, rural solar monitoring in Nepal, and US solar capacity scaling to 737.8 GW by 2035.\n- Utility grid regulations for flexible connections supporting community solar (US states enforcing new rules).\n\n### Oil & Gas\n- No direct signals in the current feed.\n\n### Data Centers & AI\n- AI-driven \"inference economics\" and digital twin technologies for floating PV applications.\n- Security of critical subsea infrastructure affecting data centers (seizure of ship for alleged subsea cable damage).\n\n### Semiconductors\n- Intel’s Arizona fab operational status and strategic importance.\n- China wafer pricing trends suggesting module price shifts near CNY 1/W in 2026.\n\n### Critical Minerals / Rare Earths\n- India’s mandate for minimum 20% domestic content in battery storage signals supply chain localization efforts.\n\n## 3) Regions / Companies Appearing Repeatedly\n- China (solar manufacturing, wafer pricing, offshore wind capacity).\n- US (solar market growth, offshore wind projects, flexible grid connections).\n- UK (record solar CfD deployments).\n- India (domestic content mandate for batteries, large PV manufacturer Waaree Energies).\n- Orsted (offshore wind project challenge in US).\n- Intel (semiconductor fab in Arizona).\n\n## 4) Constraints / Risks Implied by Headlines\n- Regulatory/permitting delays impacting large offshore wind projects (Orsted’s US halt).\n- Potential project exits or supply chain disruptions in China solar manufacturing (Eging PV project uncertainty).\n- Rising pricing pressure and market volatility for solar wafers/modules (China wafer leaders raising quotes).\n- Infrastructure security and geopolitical risks affecting subsea cables (Finnish seizure of ship, Russian crew detained).\n- Utilities shifting to fixed charges may deter efficiency investments and community solar adoption.\n\n---\n\nThis watchlist highlights critical developments in renewables scale-up, semiconductor supply chain evolution, AI adoption in energy asset management, and emerging geopolitical risks to infrastructure impacting transmission and data centers."
