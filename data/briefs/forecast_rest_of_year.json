  "summary_md": "# PTD Today Forward Watchlist (Rest of 2026)  \n*Based on headline signals from last 30 days*\n\n---\n\n## 1) Themes to Watch  \n- Geopolitical tensions impacting oil & gas supply linked to Venezuela and associated US military strikes  \n- Offshore wind project regulatory and investment challenges, particularly US halts vs. new co-ownerships in Europe  \n- Solar PV market dynamics, including record contract for difference (CfD) deployment in UK and pricing pressure in China  \n- Increasing integration of AI in energy and renewables tech, including floating PV and data center economics  \n- Risks to subsea communications infrastructure amid alleged sabotage incidents  \n- Domestic content requirements impacting battery storage and renewables manufacturing in India  \n\n---\n\n## 2) What to Monitor Next  \n\n**Grid / Transmission**  \n- Impact of flexible grid connection policies for community solar in US states on grid modernization and efficiency  \n- Security and vulnerability of subsea cables after Finnish police intervened in cable-cutting incident  \n\n**Renewables**  \n- Progress and regulatory environment of the US’s largest offshore wind projects (e.g., Orsted $5B offshore wind halted) alongside new investments like Apollo’s stake in Hornsea 3  \n- UK solar sector’s trajectory with anticipated record CfD deployments in 2026  \n- Price shifts and manufacturing challenges in China’s solar wafer & module markets (potential module price around CNY 1/W)  \n- Scaling of domestic content rules for battery storage projects in India and impact on supply chain localization  \n- Deployment of AI-powered tools (digital twins) to optimize floating PV installations  \n\n**Oil & Gas**  \n- US strategic interest and military operations linked to Venezuelan oil fields affecting production and regional stability  \n\n**Data Centers & AI**  \n- AI economics influence on data center investment, particularly AI inference and sustaining trade viability (Plexo Capital, Deepwater insights)  \n- Adoption of AI in renewable tech monitoring and optimization (digital twins for floating PV)  \n\n**Critical Minerals**  \n- Not enough information in headlines about rare earths or critical minerals directly, but India’s battery storage local content mandate may affect critical minerals sourcing  \n\n---\n\n## 3) Regions / Companies Appearing Repeatedly  \n- Venezuela (oil and military conflict zones)  \n- US (regulatory moves, military actions, market outlooks for solar & AI/data center economics)  \n- China (solar manufacturing and offshore wind turbine capacity leadership)  \n- UK (solar CfD deployments, offshore wind projects like Hornsea 3)  \n- India (domestic content mandates and PV manufacturing leadership - Waaree Energies, Tata Power Renewable)  \n- Orsted (US offshore wind project challenges)  \n- Apollo (investment in UK offshore wind)  \n\n---\n\n## 4) Constraints / Risks Implied by Headlines  \n- Geopolitical instability from US strikes in Venezuela threatening oil supply chain stability  \n- Regulatory uncertainty and project halts in US offshore wind sector potentially slowing renewable capacity growth  \n- Potential exits or financial strain on Chinese solar manufacturers impacting global supply chains  \n- Infrastructure vulnerability highlighted by subsea cable sabotage, risk to digital communications and data centers  \n- Utility rate structures shifting toward fixed charges may penalize energy efficiency and community solar growth  \n\n---\n\n*End of Watchlist*"
