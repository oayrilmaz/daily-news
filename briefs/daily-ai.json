      "body": "Several grid operators are reportedly exploring AI agents to optimize dispatch across conventional and inverter-based resources. These pilots are framed as decision-support overlays rather than replacements for real-time protection and control. The practical implication is shorter project timelines for incremental gains but new integration complexity at boundary interfaces. Vendors and system integrators could face pressure to standardize APIs and data schemas quickly. That standardization pressure may prompt accelerated firmware and middleware releases. Cybersecurity posture and certification expectations are a recurring constraint across scenarios. Watch for operational assurance language and staged rollback plans becoming common in procurement docs.",

Transformer core-steel and certain polymer insulators are mentioned in procurement signals as constrained. The scenario suggests EPCs may face harder choices: accept longer delivery times or switch to alternative specifications that require requalification. Requalification could trigger additional testing and grid-connection delays. Conditional price adjustments may appear in supplier quotes as a near-term strategy. Project owners could re-phase milestones to decouple long-lead electrical equipment from civil works. Monitor for upticks in supplier lead-time notices and revised manufacturing schedules.",
