      "body": "Grid operators appear to be encountering increasing variability from behind-the-meter solar and aggregated storage. System planners are reportedly re-weighting scenarios that previously assumed slower DER uptake. That dynamic raises new operational questions about short-circuit levels, frequency response, and protection coordination. There is a rising expectation that synchronous-condenser deployments and inverter-based resource controls will be prioritized in near-term plans. Scenario watch: faster DER adoption could compress timelines for substation upgrades near urban load centers. What to monitor: coordination between distribution utilities and transmission operators on DER visibility and active management. The net effect may be heavier near-term capital allocation toward adaptive protection and observability tools.",
