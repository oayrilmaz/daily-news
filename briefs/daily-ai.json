These systems are being integrated into existing SCADA and EMS workflows as advisory layers rather than full control loops in many deployments. Expectations are that adoption will accelerate where congestion and renewable penetration are highest. Scenario watch suggests interoperability gaps between vendor AI stacks and legacy protection schemes could arise during stressed conditions. What to monitor are instances where AI-driven dispatch conflicts with protection settings or market dispatch signals. Operators may need to set conservative gating policies while validation processes mature. Vendors and utilities are expected to formalize API and semantic model standards over the next 6–12 months. The near-term operational focus will be on human-in-the-loop safeguards and deterministic fallbacks.",
