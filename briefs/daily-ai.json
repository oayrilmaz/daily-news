These pilots are framed as resilience enhancers rather than replacements for market mechanisms. Early indications suggest models can shave peak stress windows but may require new telemetry and faster communications. That introduces integration risk with legacy SCADA stacks and potential vendor coordination needs. Scenario planning now often incorporates AI performance ranges under extreme weather stress. What to monitor are interoperability incidents and incremental regulatory guidance on automated control. The net expectation is improved short-term balancing but a transitional spike in integration and cybersecurity workload.",

This concentration also increases the negotiating leverage of processing hubs and traders. Scenario planning now routinely includes trade-disruption and export-control contingencies.
