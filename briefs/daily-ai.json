Expectations are that these models will be used to triage operator attention rather than replace core protection logic. Scenario watch: models may reveal correlations between asset alarms and near-term outage probability that were previously opaque. What to monitor are integration pathways that preserve deterministic protection while surfacing probabilistic insights. Vendors and utilities will need to agree on governance for model updates and human-in-the-loop thresholds. A near-term outcome could be tightening of maintenance windows driven by AI-prioritized risk, changing contractor scheduling dynamics.",
