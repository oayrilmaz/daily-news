      "body": "Multiple signals point to pilots deploying machine learning models on operational telemetry to flag emerging faults earlier than traditional alarms. The models promise faster identification of abnormal thermal trends and transient behavior that precede equipment failures. Integration into control-room workflows is proving harder than lab results suggested, with human-in-the-loop oversight remaining a central design constraint. Governance issues around explainability and model drift are being debated within operator groups as a scenario watch. Cyber and data-quality requirements are emerging as gating factors for scaling solutions across wide-area operations. Expect uneven uptake: well-resourced operators may accelerate, while smaller utilities take a wait-and-see approach to maturity and compliance.",
