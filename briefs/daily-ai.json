      "body": "Signals indicate several transmission operators are testing AI models that fuse sensor, weather, and topology data to prioritize dispatch. These pilots are framed as means to move from condition-based alerts to ranked work orders. Expectations are that where models show early reliability gains, procurement and maintenance routines will be adjusted to accelerate repairs. Scenario watch: if models reduce false positives, crews may be reallocated away from routine patrols toward targeted interventions. What to monitor: vendor integration timelines and pilot-to-production transition metrics. There is uncertainty over data quality and model drift as seasonal conditions change. Operators will need governance frameworks to prevent overreliance on automated triage. Overall, the signal points to incremental operational leverage rather than immediate large-scale automation.",
