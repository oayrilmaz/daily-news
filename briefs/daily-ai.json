Upstream ore quality and transport costs remain prominent variables that could limit realized benefits. The timing from project finance to first output is lengthy, keeping short-term tightness plausible. Secondary sourcing and recycling are visible as complementary signals but currently limited in scale.

Prefabricated units can reduce onsite civil work and shorten commissioning windows in constrained geographies. Factory capacity and standardization of designs become central to deliverability and quality control. Local content and logistics remain important variables that can influence total cost and schedule.
