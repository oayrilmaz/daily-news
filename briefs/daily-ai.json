These tests often run in advisory mode but are designed to reduce decision latency during peak events. The scenario to monitor is acceleration from advisory to semi-automated control over the next 12–24 months, which would shift responsibilities across operators and vendors. Integration friction is likely where legacy SCADA/EMS systems impose latency or data-format constraints. Governance frameworks and certification requirements are not yet standardized, creating potential regulatory attention and procurement delays. Vendors may consolidate features into fewer platforms, pressuring smaller integrators and reshaping maintenance contracts.",

Recycling and urban-mining pilots are scaling but remain dependent on consistent feedstock and economic incentives. Processing capacity closer to consumption centers shortens supply chains but requires investment and regulatory clarity. Trade routing and export policy signals from producing regions can create short-notice redistributions that ripple through OEM procurement. Firms are increasingly modeling circular-supply options and forming off-take agreements tied to recycling streams. The scenario to watch is whether recycled volumes can meaningfully backstop demand growth in critical segments within 18–36 months.",

Standardization pressures increase as buyers seek interchangeability and predictable lead times.

This elevates vendors that can present hardened designs and managed-detection offerings. Implementing OT resilience measures can increase upfront costs and integration complexity, but buyers view them as insurance against extended outages and reputational damage.
