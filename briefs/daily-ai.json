      "body": "Multiple operational patterns from recent deployments point to reduced alarm fatigue when edge models filter telemetry locally. Expectations are that localized ML scoring will shift some decisioning from central control rooms to feeder-level controllers. This scenario raises questions about interoperability and how coordination with existing SCADA will be handled. What to monitor is whether utilities standardize on model update cadences and rollback procedures. There is a realistic expectation that initial gains will be in detection lead time rather than full predictive replacement timelines. Operators will likely adopt hybrid workflows where human supervisors retain final authority over switching actions. Vendors may begin packaging edge model monitoring as a subscription service. This shift could also change spare-parts forecasting if models provide earlier failure signatures.",

What to monitor are accelerated condition assessments and the use of thermal imaging and dissolved gas analytics to triage needs. There is a plausible operational risk if multiple regional utilities push replacements into the same supplier windows. Longer-term, the market could see more modular, serviceable transformer designs to reduce replacement impact. EPCs may propose phased substation projects to manage cashflow and delivery risk.",
