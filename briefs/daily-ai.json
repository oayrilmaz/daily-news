These pilots emphasize probabilistic reserve needs and dynamic thermal limits over fixed schedules. The expectation is not instant replacement of human control rooms but more frequent advisory layers that influence operator decisions. Scenario watch should include integration complexity with existing SCADA and protection schemes. A realistic timeline would see advisory AI tools used in constrained events first before broader automation. Monitor vendor model validation approaches and third-party benchmarking activity. The risk profile centers on inadequate dataset coverage and edge-case misestimation. Operators may need incremental certification and regulatory sign-off pathways.",

The scenario is driven by congested supply chains and permitting delays that make on-site build time a liability. Factory testing promises faster commissioning and predictable quality, but transportation and site-access constraints can limit applicability. OEM partnerships focused on interface standardization and plug-and-play protection panels improve uptake. Owners may face trade-offs in customization versus speed.
