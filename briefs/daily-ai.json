      "body": "Operators are increasingly experimenting with machine-learning ensembles to predict net load and inverter behavior. These models can reduce forecast error in many scenarios, but they also introduce correlated failure modes if training sets lack rare events. When multiple regions adopt similar algorithms, common-mode forecast errors could increase simultaneous reserve demand. Scenario watch: reduced reserve procurement in regions with strong AI signals could amplify exposure if models underperform during extreme weather. What to monitor: evidence of operators trimming spinning reserves, changes in market clearing protocols, and vendor disclosures about model robustness testing. This is an expectations-driven intelligence item highlighting potential systemic interactions rather than a confirmed trend. The operational takeaway is to plan for both tighter day-ahead forecasts and contingency plans for model-driven misalignments.",

This item frames an operational vulnerability rather than asserting current failures. For planners, the signal suggests revisiting spare-part inventories and mutual-aid protocols.",

However, operators are exploring combinations of battery energy storage systems (BESS) with fuel-cell or hydrogen options to cover multi-day outages without excessive diesel use.
