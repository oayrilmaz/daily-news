These gains often rely on data feeds that lack full observability, creating sensitivity to missing or delayed telemetry. Model drift appears as a recurring scenario risk when weather or generation mixes diverge from training data. There are practical trade-offs between near-term operational benefit and the need for robust fallback procedures. Vendors are beginning to propose hybrid control stacks that embed explainability and human-in-the-loop mechanisms. Expect growing emphasis on validation, stress-testing, and redundancy as pilots scale to production.",
