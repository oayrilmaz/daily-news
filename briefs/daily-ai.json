The intelligence picture suggests trial dispatch windows are widening to shore up intra-day balancing. Grid operators are being watched for changes to ancillary service procurement that favor faster response assets. There is an expectation that aggregated residential and commercial flexible loads will be used more aggressively in hours with low renewable output. Supply constraints on fast‑response inverters could limit near-term scalability of these measures.
