These tests emphasize rapid re-dispatch, frequency containment and distributed resource aggregation. The exercise patterns suggest a pivot toward leveraging distributed flexibility rather than only relying on centralized reserves. Staff models now include higher penetration of behind-the-meter storage and demand response. Expect scenario planners to prioritize communications between distribution operators and bulk system control rooms. There is a practical emphasis on operational playbooks for rapid DER aggregation and islanding. What to monitor are market signals and alerts that indicate when such playbooks could be triggered in real operations.",

These windows can create sharp net load ramps when solar output drops and many batteries attempt to transition to discharge. Constraints are most acute where transmission alternatives are limited and where interconnection queues have high concentrations of storage. Market formulations and price signals currently under revision could redistribute charging into flatter profiles. There is an operational preference in some scenarios for controlled charging signals from the system operator to avoid synchronous behavior. Longer term, more flexible tariffs and coordination mechanisms may be required. Short-term monitoring should look for localized congestion events tied to charging spikes.",
