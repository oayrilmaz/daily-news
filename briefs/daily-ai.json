      "body": "A growing set of pilots combine machine learning forecasts with optimization routines to influence short-term dispatch decisions. These initiatives are often framed as risk-reduction measures rather than primary control levers at first. Operators may layer AI outputs onto existing SCADA and EMS workflows, raising integration and validation needs. Real-world trials expose models to edge cases—extreme weather, multi-day outages, and unusual demand patterns—which stress test both algorithms and data pipelines. Governance questions emerge early about model explainability, roll-back procedures, and cyber-hardened ML pipelines. Vendors are packaging 'explainability' and audit trails as a selling point, but deployment remains experimental. Scenario watch: partial automation with human-in-the-loop appears the most likely near-term pathway while regulatory and reliability frameworks catch up.",

OEM consolidation in certain equipment lines amplifies single-supplier risk, particularly for legacy parts. Obsolescence of control and protection relays complicates retrofit planning; many utilities are assessing both retrofit and full replacement trajectories. Inventory optimization models are being revisited but require better failure-mode data to be effective. Workarounds like refurbishing and reverse-engineering parts are increasing but introduce quality and warranty trade-offs. Scenario watch: a staggered procurement strategy combined with modular retrofit designs reduces exposure, but requires upfront engineering discipline.",

Behind-the-meter storage is emerging as a dual-purpose asset: resilience and cost optimization during peak pricing.

Developers are testing firmware and control strategies intended to provide synthetic inertia and fast frequency response.
