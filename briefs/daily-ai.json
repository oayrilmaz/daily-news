The modular approach promises compressed onsite work and more predictable commissioning timelines. Developers may prioritize plug-and-play transformer and switchgear skids that can be swapped with reduced system downtime. The expectation is a potential uptick in early procurement of standardized modules to reserve manufacturing slots. EPCs could face new bill-of-materials pressures as serial production demands different vendor relationships than bespoke builds.
