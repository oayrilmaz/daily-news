      "body": "Operators have been reporting patterns consistent with lower system inertia during high renewable output windows. These signals include faster frequency deviations and tighter margin events that challenge legacy protections. The expectation is that more grid-scale inverters will be required to provide synthetic inertia or fast frequency response. There's an emerging scenario watch that protection coordination must be updated to avoid nuisance trips as converter dynamics differ from synchronous machines. Capital and operational choices will likely bifurcate between retrofitting existing assets for fast-response services and procuring dedicated stability resources. What to monitor are formal notices from balancing authorities and procurement solicitations for inertia-like services.",

Concurrently, global lead times for large power transformers and certain insulating components have not normalized, creating procurement friction. The scenario watch suggests that a single critical failure could cascade into protracted restoration timelines where spares are scarce. Engineering teams should expect increased prioritization of condition-based monitoring and pre-ordering strategies for long-lead items. There is also an expectation of accelerated investment in mobile or temporary transformer solutions to bridge gaps. What to monitor are supplier lead-time notices and utility outage restoration time updates.",
