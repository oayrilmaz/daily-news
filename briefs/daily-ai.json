These tools are being framed as probabilistic decision aids rather than automatic control authority. Vendors report early improvements in intraday scheduling accuracy, particularly where datasets include distributed-storage telemetry. Integration work remains non-trivial: data standardization and cyber posture upgrades are recurring implementation frictions. There is an expectation that reserve procurement strategies could shift toward more dynamic, shorter-duration products if confidence in forecasts grows.
