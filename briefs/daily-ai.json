These pilots emphasize cross-domain inputs such as weather, market prices, and inverter telemetry. The intelligence framing indicates a shift toward models that can recommend dispatch or curtailment actions rather than only provide alerts. Integration complexity is a recurring challenge, especially tying ML outputs to existing SCADA and EMS workflows. Human-in-the-loop designs are being prioritized to preserve operator oversight and auditability. Expect phased deployments where AI recommendations are constrained to advisory modes before elevated automation is allowed. Long-term scenarios include AI-assisted ancillary service optimization and coordinated DER aggregation for frequency response.",
