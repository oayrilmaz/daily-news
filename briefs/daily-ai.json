      "body": "Operators and vendors are testing AI control stacks that coordinate distributed assets for congestion relief and frequency support. These systems promise faster response and economic optimization compared with traditional supervisory controls. Signals indicate the potential for control interactions to produce unintended fast dynamics when multiple AI agents act on overlapping assets. Scenario watch: simultaneous automated dispatches from different vendors could create oscillatory flows on transmission corridors. What to monitor are disturbance records, near-miss reports, and simulation results showing non-linear interactions. Expect regulators and system planners to demand transparent validation frameworks and formal verification of control logic. Coordination practices between vendors and TSOs are likely to surface as a priority in near-term planning. This is an intelligence posture, not a prescriptive claim about current incidents.",

Emerging load patterns driven by electric vehicles and heat pumps introduce more frequent ramping and higher peak demands. Signals suggest accelerated insulation aging and increased risk of tap-changer wear in assets not designed for cyclic duty. Scenario watch includes clusters of failures in hot-spots where capacity margins are thin. What to monitor are dissolved gas analysis trends, tap-changer maintenance intervals, and short-circuit duty changes. Expectations are that asset owners will prioritize condition-based monitoring and targeted replacement of critical units. This intelligence framing should guide maintenance reprioritization rather than implying current failures.",
