Transmission constraints in key corridors are being flagged in forecast runs as potential pinch points for redispatch. Distribution-level outages from localized equipment failures could compound system-level balancing needs during peak hours. Market-derived reserve signals are tightening in several zones, prompting expectations of elevated balancing actions. Grid operators may shift to more conservative unit commitment and proactive demand response activation. Planning teams are running multi-day what-if scenarios around generator outages coinciding with peak cold events. This is a scenario watch rather than a confirmed crisis; decision-makers should monitor near-term weather and forced outage reports.",
