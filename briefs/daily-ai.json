      "body": "Grid operators are reporting patterns consistent with more frequent bidirectional power flows on formerly unidirectional feeders. These flow reversals can shift loading and thermal patterns on lines and transformers in ways that legacy protection and thermal models did not anticipate. Expectations are that conventional contingency plans will need revisiting to accommodate fast, localized injections and withdrawals from DERs. Scenario watch: if not addressed, relay coordination and fault-detection sensitivity may produce nuisance trips during peak DER ramp events. What to monitor are system separation risks during high DER output slices combined with low load. Signals also suggest increased use of distributed control schemes and advanced inverter settings, which can help but add complexity to operational planning. Operational teams should consider targeted dynamic studies and temporary changes to protection settings during known high-DER conditions.",

What to monitor are outage scheduling records and spare-part inventories at regional warehouses.
