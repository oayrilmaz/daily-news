      "body": "Multiple system operators are reportedly assessing AI-driven dispatch layers to reduce reliance on conventional spinning reserves and to integrate inverter-based resources more tightly into balancing regimes. These efforts are framed as scenario testing rather than universal rollouts, with pilot scope focused on congested nodes and distribution-edge assets. Implementers are likely to face data-quality and latency constraints that influence the design of communication and sensor upgrades. Messaging from operators suggests preference for modular AI agents that can be audited and rolled back, a notable expectation for procurement teams. Vendors are positioning offerings that combine probabilistic forecasting with state-estimation adjustments, a dynamic that could shift transformer and protection-spec requirements. The adoption curve will depend on regulatory comfort with algorithmic decisioning, which remains a watch item in many jurisdictions.",
