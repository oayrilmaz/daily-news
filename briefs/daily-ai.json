      "body": "A growing set of pilots is integrating machine-learned models into short-term dispatch and reserve activation logic. These tools aim to improve economic outcomes and predictive maintenance windows. Early scenarios indicate timing decisions can differ materially from rule-based dispatch. Those timing differences create potential edge cases for spinning and non-spinning reserve activation. Under stressed conditions the interactions could amplify contingencies rather than damp them. The intelligence posture is to treat current results as signals and to prepare contingency validation of AI outputs.",

Buyers view factory assembly as a pathway to predictable delivery windows and quality control. Yet modular approaches shift design interfaces upstream into factory controls and protection settings.

Operators report signals of differing responses across firmware versions and vendor settings.

A small number of facilities control key intermediate steps for batteries and HV conductor alloys. That concentration raises scenario risk from trade disruptions or regulatory actions.

Both approaches shift work earlier into design and factory stages. The challenge is ensuring site adaptation and interface changes can be handled without negating schedule gains.

Operators are reporting more routine reconnaissance indicators against legacy SCADA and relay networks. Many substations still operate with flat network zones and minimal segmentation. The scenario risk is that persistent scanning uncovers unpatched or exposed devices before mitigations are applied. Investment in intrusion detection, micro-segmentation, and firmware hygiene can materially reduce exposure.
