      "body": "Grid operators are indicating stress scenarios where rapid demand changes and high inverter-based resource penetration reduce available kinetic inertia. System balancing in these conditions looks to favor faster ramping thermal units and battery fleets but creates new dispatch and wear patterns. Market designs that do not explicitly value inertia or fast frequency response may see reliability costs rise. Short-term procurement and contract flexing are emerging as primary mitigations in several balancing areas. Ancillary service price volatility is a plausible outcome if resource availability tightens on cold, high-demand days. Expect operational advisories to prioritize contingency reserves and redispatch windows to maintain frequency margins.",
      "summary": "Winter demand variability is increasing reliance on fast-response assets as inertia declines. Operators may lean on batteries and fast thermal ramps while ancillary prices could become more volatile.",

These price signals may accelerate merchant build decisions for flexible thermal and storage assets in high-value corridors.

The supply chain for some transformer-grade alloys remains geographically concentrated, introducing geopolitical and logistical scenario risk.
