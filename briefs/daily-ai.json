Operators are testing synthetic inertia and advanced control schemes in limited pilots while monitoring frequency volatility expectations. AI-assisted dispatch and anomaly detection are being trialed as scenario tools to reconcile fast dynamics with legacy protection settings. Grid-forming inverter strategies are emerging as a likely foundational element of near-term stability playbooks. Procurement and interconnection requirements may shift to favor devices able to deliver active stability services. Vendors and OEMs are positioning firmware and service offerings to address these expected needs. What to monitor are rule changes or pilot outcomes that could accelerate retrofits and contractual obligations for new resources.",
