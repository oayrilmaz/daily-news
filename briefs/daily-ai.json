Decision cycles for prioritizing which substations receive mobile transformers or temporary generation are being formalized as part of contingency playbooks. Battery management systems and their state-of-health analytics are being treated as first-line indicators for load-shedding alternatives. Grid-control centers are signaling an increased reliance on advanced forecasting to stagger noncritical maintenance. Procurement teams are being asked to validate availability of tap changers and HV bushings within 30–90 day windows. There is a growing scenario watch around coordinated outages that span multiple utilities due to shared suppliers. What to monitor next are shipping manifests and supplier capacity notices that would confirm tighter-than-expected replacement timelines.",
