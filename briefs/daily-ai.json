      "body": "Multiple program-level trials are showing potential for AI to speed fault isolation and restoration decisions. These trials are also creating new integration points between control systems and analytics platforms. Increased automation could lower human workload but may reduce operator situational awareness without suitable interfaces. The expanded software footprint is creating fresh cyber exposures around model access and telemetry channels. Vendors and utilities are experimenting with explainability layers to support operator trust. Testing cadence is accelerating, raising the probability of immature deployments reaching operations sooner than expected. Observers should expect a cycle of iterative hardening as early issues are exposed. Successful pilots may shorten O&M timelines for certain functions. Conversely, high-profile incidents could prompt conservative rollouts and regulatory scrutiny. The net scenario is a near-term period of elevated change management and cybersecurity focus.",

Inventory management is emerging as a competitive differentiator for large project developers and EPCs. Some operators are accelerating condition-based monitoring deployments to better target interventions. The cumulative effect is a reorientation of procurement from lowest-price to availability-weighted sourcing. This could favor suppliers with flexible manufacturing footprints.

Recycling economics are improving as raw-material prices and processing yields evolve. The shift is driven by both commercial incentives and policy pressures to secure domestic supply chains. New refining capacity for recovered materials is attracting investment interest, though scale-up timelines remain uncertain. Technical variability in feedstock is a persistent challenge for consistent output purity. If recycling scales, it could meaningfully cushion demand for newly mined material over the medium term. However, recycling alone is unlikely to fully offset primary supply shortfalls in the near term. Geopolitical considerations are accelerating investments in diversified refining footprints.
