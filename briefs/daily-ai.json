These signals appear correlated with rapid cloud transients and tight thermal plant scheduling windows. Protection settings and under-frequency load-shedding thresholds designed for synchronous inertia may not align with these new dynamic profiles. Operators are plausibly adjusting reserves, but such adjustments create economic and dispatch trade-offs.

Parallel integration of third-party analytics without hardened interfaces elevates attack surface and interoperability failure modes.
