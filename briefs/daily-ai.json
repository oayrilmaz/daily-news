      "body": "Operational data patterns show tighter reserve margins in areas with concentrated compute facilities, a signal worth monitoring. Weather volatility this season is expected to increase heating load variability, creating simultaneous peaks. Data-center load profiles are shifting toward sustained high baseloads with intermittent very high demand when AI training clusters run. Grid operators may need to re-evaluate reserve deployment and ramping strategies under these compounded conditions. Transmission constraints into metropolitan load centers are an existing friction point that could limit redispatch options. Short-duration storage and demand response are likely to be central to near-term mitigation strategies. Scenario watch: coordinated dispatch between balancing authorities and large consumers could mitigate extreme events if communications and commercial arrangements scale quickly. What to monitor: reserve margin notices, forced outage reports for thermal plants, and new large connection requests from hyperscalers. Expectation: near-term operational stress absent rapid demand-side or storage deployment in constrained areas.",

Scenario watch: projects dependent on single-source transformer suppliers are at higher risk of schedule slippage.
