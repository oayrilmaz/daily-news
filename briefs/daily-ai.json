These early deployments emphasize reducing false alarms and surfacing emergent risks rather than autonomous control. Vendors are positioning explainability and operator-in-the-loop workflows as selling points to ease adoption. Integration challenges remain significant, especially around data quality, latency, and standard communications. Regulatory comfort with AI-assisted decisioning is uneven across regions and may slow rollouts. The practical benefit will hinge on change management inside control rooms and the ability to demonstrate reduced restoration times in pilots.",
