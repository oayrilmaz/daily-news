These integrations aim to shorten decision cycles for congestion relief and frequency excursions. Early scenarios suggest operators may rely on AI recommendations for prioritizing fast-start resources and curtailment steps.

Storage and demand-response participation has grown but may not yet provide sufficient downward pressure in all hours. Grid congestion and import constraints can amplify local price spikes even when broader system supply is adequate. Some operators may open emergency market mechanisms more frequently if these patterns persist. There is a scenario where higher volatility draws speculative capital into short-duration storage, altering bid dynamics further.
