These integrations raise expectations for improved utilization of existing transmission assets while also concentrating decision-making in software stacks. Scenario watch centers on interoperability gaps and the potential for cascading misconfigurations when models share state across regions. What to monitor are communications protocols, fallback modes, and human-in-the-loop thresholds in deployments. Vendors and system operators seem to be prioritizing latency and explainability, but there is uncertainty about standardized validation practices. Adoption could compress outage windows and enable smoother renewables integration if controls are robust. Conversely, increased software centralization could amplify common-mode failure risk without agreed testing frameworks.",
