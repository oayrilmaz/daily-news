Grid planners are framing procurement of synthetic inertia and grid-forming controls as a near-term priority. Vendors and integrators are positioning firmware and converter-level upgrades as deliverables that can reduce frequency nadir risks. There is expectation of more coordinated procurement across balancing areas to avoid fragmented solutions that fail interoperability tests. Scenario watch should focus on whether procurement moves toward service-based contracts or hardware upgrades embedded in new assets. Implementation risks include certification cycles, testing protocols, and the need for updated protection schemes. What to monitor: reliability councils issuing guidance, vendor performance claims, and pilot deployments at high-VRE nodes.",
