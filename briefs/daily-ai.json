      "body": "Multiple signals point to an uptick in trials of AI orchestration layering on existing energy management systems. These pilots aim to coordinate thermal units, storage, and distributed flexibility in near-real-time. Expectations are that improved forecasts and automated dispatch could shave peak exposure and reduce reserve needs if models prove reliable. Integration is nontrivial: legacy SCADA, latency constraints, and regulatory approval paths are likely to slow full deployments. Validation and explainability of model actions are a recurring scenario watch, particularly for safety-critical operations. Vendors and grid teams appear to be emphasizing staged rollouts and human-in-the-loop controls. Scenario planners should expect incremental benefits in 12–24 months for participating regions, not immediate system-wide transformations.",
