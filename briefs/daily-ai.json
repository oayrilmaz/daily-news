These patterns are producing signals that ramping and reserve resources are being called more frequently during shoulder hours. Scenario watch: localized constraints could increase reliance on fast-start gas and demand response. This dynamic may exacerbate fuel-security conversations at utilities and among large consumers. The profile favors assets that can deliver rapid, sustained response rather than one-off peaks. Expect communications from operators emphasizing contingency procedures and market mechanisms that prioritize flexibility.",
