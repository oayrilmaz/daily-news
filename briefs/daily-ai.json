Fuel procurement chains, particularly diesel and gas for on-site generation, are under pressure from regional logistics and price swings. Some facilities report prioritizing critical IT loads during extended grid events and shifting nonessential workloads to alternative sites. Microgrid integration and hybrid storage-generation configurations are being positioned as mitigation pathways.
