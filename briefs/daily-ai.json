The stated objective in testing is reduced human latency for frequency and contingency responses. This shift increases sensitivity to training-data drift and model governance failures in systems that directly influence dispatch decisions. Centralized control rooms integrating AI outputs may see improved situational awareness, but also a concentration of failure modes when data quality degrades. Vendors and integrators are reportedly prioritizing deterministic fallbacks to manual or rule-based control in early deployments. Regulators and reliability councils are watching these pilots to reassess standards around automated interventions. The net effect on reliability will hinge on validation regimes, sensor redundancy, and incident triage procedures implemented in the next procurement cycles.",
