      "body": "Across several planning regions, short-duration stability signals are prompting scenario work on procurement of inverter-based grid services. Planners are framing these as both reliability gaps and new revenue streams for storage and advanced inverter assets. Procurement timelines for frequency services are being shortened in planning scenarios to hedge against summer stress events. OEMs are being asked to certify inverter firmware for grid-support functions earlier in project cycles. This shift has implications for testing facilities, relay settings, and protection coordination at the substation level. Market designers may lean toward capacity carve-outs for dynamic response as a conservative hedge. The risk for developers is a mismatch between product capability and contracted performance windows.",

Modular approaches shift risk back to OEMs and demand tighter factory acceptance protocols. Projects with strict in-service deadlines are likely to preference modular vendors in upcoming tender cycles.
