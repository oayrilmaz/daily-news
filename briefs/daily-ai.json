      "body": "Operators across several regions are reported to be increasing use of algorithmic tools for fast re-dispatch during peak periods. These activities are framed as trials and scenario exercises designed to evaluate speed and coordination benefits under stress. Early indications suggest improved response times but also reveal integration gaps with legacy protection and manual control procedures. There is a scenario risk that automation edge cases generate unexpected control interactions during rapid ramp events. Equipment vendors and grid operators are reportedly focusing on interoperability and real-time telemetry fidelity to mitigate that risk. Workforce readiness, especially triage procedures for operators to override automated decisions, is emerging as a critical constraint. What to monitor are abnormal alarm patterns, frequency nadirs, and post-exercise incident reports that could indicate fragile interplay between AI tools and field equipment.",
