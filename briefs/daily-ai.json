      "body": "Operators are reportedly shifting from isolated control-room tests to live pilots that coordinate batteries, demand response, and wind farms under a single control plane. The framing is scenario-based: orchestration aims to reduce ramp volatility and manage intra-hour congestion events. Early deployments focus on constrained corridors where renewables cause rapid net-load swings. Engineers are testing rule sets for priority, visibility, and safe human override to mitigate automation risk. Integration of telemetry from legacy substations remains a practical impediment and a focal point of workstreams. This transition period increases the need to monitor interoperability, communications latency, and fallback procedures. Expect more pilots to surface as a signal of accelerating operational acceptance rather than immediate widescale adoption.",

The intelligence frame is scenario-driven: a single forced outage in a tight area could cascade into extended restoration timelines. Long manufacturing lead times for large power transformers mean temporary measures—load transfer, managed limitations, and emergency procurement—are being emphasized. Secondary markets and refurbishment are being explored but capacity is limited. Insurers and owners are re-evaluating contingency plans and rotating spares across portfolios. This dynamic raises the importance of condition-based monitoring upgrades and predictive maintenance pilots. Operators should treat reduced spare buffers as an elevated operational watch item rather than a near-term catastrophe trigger.",
