      "body": "Market and operational signals suggest pilots and internal studies are increasingly considering AI coordination layers for aggregated fast frequency response. These approaches frame DERs and BESS as coordinated assets rather than isolated participants. The intelligence scenario is that AI layers could reduce reliance on traditional spinning reserves in some regions. Implementation would drive new telemetry and low-latency communications requirements at substations and feeders. It would also create new failure modes and cybersecurity vectors that operators must anticipate. Vendors are likely to propose managed orchestration services as part of their product suites. This scenario could accelerate procurement of phasor-level monitoring, edge compute, and tighter vendor-operator SLAs. What to monitor are pilot designs, latency SLAs, and any regulatory carve-outs for AI-mediated control.",
