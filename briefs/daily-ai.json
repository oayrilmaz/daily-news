Expectations include accelerated trials of aggregated DER control and revised dispatch economics for behind-the-meter storage. Scenario watch: limited telemetry standards may create uneven visibility across balancing areas, complicating coordinated response. Market signals could push utilities to fast-track firmware and communications upgrades for legacy inverter fleets. Planning teams may be re-evaluating reserve margins with higher weighting for flexible resources. Contingency exercises that incorporate DER aggregation are becoming more common in planning discussions. Longer term, operators may shift procurement priorities toward technologies that provide firming capability within short notice windows.",

Expectations include increased procurement of refurbished and retrofitted units alongside new low-GWP alternatives. Scenario watch: inconsistent performance data on alternative insulating gases could slow adoption if short-term field results lag expectations. Vendors are prioritizing field-proven retrofit kits to extend life while new-spec equipment faces longer delivery windows. Grid owners may be creating prioritized replacement lists based on failure-mode risk scoring. Inspections using drones and thermography are likely to be more widely deployed to triage critical assets.
