      "body": "Grid behavior in systems with a large share of inverter-based resources is evolving faster than legacy protection and control paradigms. Signals show more frequent instances where conventional stability metrics understate short-duration voltage and frequency excursions. That mismatch is stressing relaying schemes and automatic controls that assume synchronous-machine behavior. Expectations include more conservative ride-through and droop settings in the near term, with knock-on effects on renewable curtailment and ancillary procurement. There is a scenario risk that reactive power support gaps will surface during extreme dispatch sequences. Operators may lean on fast frequency response and synthetic inertia services, increasing demand for battery and converter capabilities. What to monitor are operational advisories, protection coordination changes, and short-notice procurements for grid-forming resources.",

Spare parts inventories remain lean in many operators' balance sheets, increasing reliance on long-lead procurement or cross-operator trades. Expectations are for extended outage restoration timelines if multiple failures coincide, particularly for bulk transformers and large power circuit breakers. That dynamic elevates the value of strategic spares, temporary replacement assets, and modular transformer solutions. There is a scenario where logistics constraints and port congestion further lengthen delivery windows. Operators are likely to emphasize condition-based replacement and accelerated testing to prioritize near-term risk. What to monitor are shipment notifications and lead-time changes from suppliers, and any regional pooling agreements among utilities.",

Expectations are for more dual-fuel genset specifications and integration of on-site renewables with energy storage to reduce single-point failure risk. There is a scenario where fuel supply or price volatility prompts temporary operational curtailments if on-site inventories are insufficient. Microgrid controllers and islanding capability are being prioritized in new builds and retrofit projects. That trend drives demand for modular switchgear, automatic transfer schemes, and harmonized protection for mixed-generation environments.

Expectations are for accelerating investment cases for point-to-point HVDC and synchronous condensers in constrained zones. There is a scenario where permitting and social acceptance delays for HVAC reinforcements push more capacity to HVDC alternatives. That shift affects substation design, with higher converter station needs and different footprint and cooling considerations. Developers and system planners may revise interconnection offers and contracts to reflect higher network upgrade costs. What to watch are queue reform initiatives and grid investment commitments that can change the economics of new renewable clusters.

Expectations are for capacity market signals to place a premium on duration and guaranteed deliverability during peak windows. There is a scenario where shorter-duration assets face compressed returns unless market products evolve to monetize fast-response attributes more consistently. Co-optimization between energy, capacity, and ancillary services is likely to become a battleground in tariff and market-rule updates.
