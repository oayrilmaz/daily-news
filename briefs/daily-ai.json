      "body": "Operators and balancing authorities appear to be testing AI models that compress forecasting and dispatch cycles into tighter windows. These pilots are framing potential reductions in reserve needs while raising questions about shared situational awareness. Model explainability is emerging as a gating factor for broader operational adoption. Integration work is described as less about accuracy and more about predictable failure modes. Human-in-the-loop procedures are being built to catch anomalous model outputs before they affect dispatch. Market design frictions may surface as automated bids interact with manual market participants. Regulators are watching for auditability gaps that could complicate post-event analysis. The near-term scenario is one of incremental adoption with layered governance rather than rapid, unchecked rollout.",

Coordinated rollouts across distributed portfolios introduce systemic risk if a firmware bug interacts with grid conditions.

Bottlenecks in conversion capacity can decouple mining output from downstream cell manufacturing. Investments in electrolytic refining and precursor synthesis are underway, but commissioning delays could create transitory gaps. Recycling streams are not yet scaled to materially offset precursor demand. Producers may prioritize high-margin contracts, reordering supply allocation across geographies.

Quality inspection bottlenecks at regional hubs could further extend delivery windows.
