      "body": "Operators report increased instances of DERs entering autonomous modes during cold snaps in prior seasons, and similar patterns are a primary scenario to monitor now.\nDER control schemes designed for summer peak shaving can behave differently during sustained low-temperature periods, producing unexpected ramping behavior at the distribution-transmission interface.\nVoltage support expectations baked into planning studies may not hold if a significant fraction of inverters switch modes or disconnect under fault or low-voltage conditions.\nThis creates a plausible pathway for localized reactive power shortfalls that stress nearby transmission assets and voltage control reserves.\nPlanning and operations teams should expect elevated communications loads and coordinate DER telemetry sampling rates to spot divergent behavior early.\nThe broader expectation is not a single-system collapse but an increased probability of localized emergency actions and constrained reserve margins in affected regions.\nScenario watch: monitor inverter telemetry, distribution operator alerts, and transmission reactive reserve activations over the next 48–72 hours.",
