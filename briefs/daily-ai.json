Expectations include tighter intra-day reserve windows and more frequent use of flexible resources. DER aggregators are appearing in operational scenarios as potential sources of both risk and flexibility depending on telemetry maturity. Scenario watch: limited visibility into aggregated DER response could magnify congestion in constrained corridors. What to monitor: telemetry update notices, DER aggregator control agreements, and ISO reserve procurement schedules.
