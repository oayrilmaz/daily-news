      "body": "Operators are increasingly experimenting with machine learning ensembles to blend meteorological data and inverter telemetry. Early scenarios suggest shorter notice of ramp events and improved day-ahead schedules in some tests. Those gains come with new failure modes tied to data drift and training set blind spots. The operational margin can improve while situational awareness degrades if explainability is limited. Vendors are packaging closed-loop control features that could alter ancillary service needs. Regulators and grid planners may need to update compliance and validation protocols to account for algorithmic updates. What to monitor are algorithm rollouts, model governance processes, and incident post-mortems that reveal common failure patterns.",
