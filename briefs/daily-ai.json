These windows are being driven by rapid swings in renewable output and concentrated demand from compute and industrial loads. Thermal plant availability patterns appear to be shifting, with longer maintenance cycles and aging-unit retirements complicating reserve planning. Grid operators are experimenting with shorter scheduling intervals and more granular ancillary procurement in response. Distributed storage and demand-side flexibility are being trialed as stop-gap measures in some markets. The cumulative picture suggests an elevated risk of localized congestion and price spikes under stress scenarios. Monitoring reserve margin methodologies and ancillary market design updates will be critical for forward-looking planning.",
