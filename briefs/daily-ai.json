Operators are flagging integration gaps between AI decision layers and legacy SCADA/EMS interfaces as a routine friction. Cyber teams are evaluating novel threat vectors where model inputs can be manipulated by false telemetry or compromised edge devices. There is a pattern of incremental rollback triggers embedded into operator procedures to retain manual override authority. Vendors are marketing closed-loop packages that promise faster time-to-benefit, though interoperability claims remain to be verified at scale. The intelligence posture is shifting from whether AI works to how operators must redesign governance, testing, and incident response.
