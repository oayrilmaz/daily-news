These signals align with increased behind-the-meter heating loads and intermittent renewable variability. Grid models are showing higher sensitivity to short-duration ramps rather than sustained peaks. This shifts attention to fast-ramping resources and demand response rather than traditional thermal margins. Scenario planning should anticipate more frequent activation of fast-start units and targeted DR events. Coordination gaps between distribution-connected DERs and transmission operators remain an area to monitor closely.",

Processing bottlenecks and concentrate logistics are likely to drive price and availability volatility for key chemistries.
