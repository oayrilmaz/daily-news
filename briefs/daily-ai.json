The framing emerging is not full autonomy but human-in-the-loop augmentation to reduce dispatcher cognitive load. Expect model outputs to be used first for hourly and near-real-time congestion forecasting before moving to automated dispatch slips. Implementation scenarios emphasize interoperability with existing SCADA and EMS rather than wholesale replacements. Data quality and latency remain common constraints cited in scenario planning. Vendors and in-house teams are weighing federated architectures to protect sensitive telemetry. Cybersecurity and fail-safe protocols are being positioned as gating factors for increased automation. The strategic implication is that early adopters will focus on marginal reliability gains and operational cost avoidance rather than large capacity savings.",
