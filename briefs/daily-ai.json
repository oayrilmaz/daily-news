What to monitor are procurement notices that reference predictive or prescriptive analytics within operations contracts. Vendors and system integrators are likely to reposition offers around explainability and regulator-aligned audit trails. There is potential for operational friction as legacy protection schemes and automated controls are adapted to interact with AI-driven advisories.
