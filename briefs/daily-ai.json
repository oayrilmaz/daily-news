Scenario watch highlights moments when rooftop PV, heat pump demand, and EV charging coincide with cold snaps. These overlaps can produce feeder-level congestion even as bulk system metrics appear stable. Expectations include more frequent operational interventions and the use of non-traditional flexibility such as residential batteries and demand response. AI-driven forecasting tools are being piloted to predict these micro-congestion events with finer granularity. There is a risk that inconsistent data standards across utilities will limit cross-jurisdictional coordination. What to monitor: coordinated dispatch signals, DER aggregation performance, and calls for temporary curtailment protocols.",
