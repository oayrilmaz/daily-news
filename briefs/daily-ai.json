      "body": "Operators are reported to be testing AI models to prioritize dispatch, manage congestion, and tune storage dispatch windows. These signals suggest potential efficiency gains but also a higher burden on validation, explainability, and incident forensics. Expect scenarios where machine recommendations require layered human verification before automatic actuation. That layered control could slow adoption but reduce operational risk in mature deployments. What to monitor are changes in staffing, new control room interfaces, and vendor claims about safe model behavior. Scenario watch: adversarial or fault-mode behavior in AI logic could surface in high-stress system events. The near-term expectation is a hybrid approach where AI provides decision support rather than direct control in most jurisdictions.",

Modular, factory-integrated substations appear in planning discussions as they can cut field completion times and reduce on-site risk. These units trade customization for speed, and operators are weighing interoperability and long-term maintenance impacts. Scenario watch: accelerated projects may prioritize modular units for medium-voltage interconnections while retaining bespoke designs for critical trunks. What to monitor are EPC tender language changes, inventory positions at major yards, and spool-ready designs from vendors. The near-term expectation is a rise in mixed-capex approaches where modular units fill short-term capacity needs. This approach could shift maintenance planning toward OEM-managed service contracts.",

What to monitor are market products for fast frequency response, changes in connection agreements, and procurement of co-located BESS.
