      "body": "Multiple deployments of AI orchestration are being trialed as a complement to conventional energy management systems, with expectations of improved short-term balancing and reduced curtailment.\nThese systems often aggregate forecasts, market signals, and device-level telemetry to recommend dispatch actions or setpoints for inverters and batteries.\nA scenario to watch is model drift during atypical weather or load patterns, which could lead to suboptimal dispatch or coordination conflicts with existing protection schemes.\nThere are signals that integration layers sometimes lack clear fallback modes for manual operator control, creating potential for slower response during incidents.\nCyber considerations are rising because AI layers introduce new data flows and interfaces between control systems and third-party models, expanding the attack surface.\nOperators are expected to test layered validation and explainability features before scaling, but timelines are uneven across regions and vendors.\nMarket interactions also matter: automated bidding or flex offers from aggregated DERs may amplify price swings if models converge on similar strategies.\nWhat to monitor are adaptation plans, incident playbooks, and vendor commitments to deterministic fallback behavior in AI-assisted control environments.",
