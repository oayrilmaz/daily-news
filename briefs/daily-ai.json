Pilots emphasize transparent models, audit trails and conservative decision envelopes to keep human operators central. Scenario watch: models that underweight rare contingencies could increase systemic risk if deployed without rigorous stress testing. Vendors are packaging forecasting, optimization and anomaly detection into single stacks, accelerating integration pressure on SCADA and EMS. What to monitor is how regulators and reliability entities respond to submissions that include automated recommendation layers. Some companies signal preference for adaptive automation only during low-risk periods as a validation step. Expect continued emphasis on simulation-driven validation and staged rollouts over the next 6–18 months.",
