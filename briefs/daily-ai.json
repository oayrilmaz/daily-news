Expectations include a mix of rule-based fallbacks and human-machine workflows to manage liability and safety. There is a scenario risk where confidence in model outputs could compress human oversight in fast-moving events, increasing operational stress. What to monitor are audit trails, model explainability features, and vendor support commitments. Vendors are positioning models as speed enhancers rather than autonomy solutions, but the boundary between assistance and automation remains porous. Grid planners will likely push for standardized test regimes and simulations before production deployments. Longer-term, regulators may require logging and certification of decision-support systems. The immediate intelligence task is to track which utilities move from lab pilots to shadow-mode operations.",

Expectations are that refurbishment demand will increase, especially for mid-voltage units where rebuild cycles are cost-effective. Scenario watch: heavy reliance on used-equipment markets could propagate legacy obsolescence and increase failure risk if testing is inconsistent. Manufacturers may prioritize new-builds with higher margins, leaving utilities to source through brokers. There is also a push for modular transformer designs to simplify maintenance and expedite swaps. What to monitor are extended lead-time alerts from supply channels and insurer responses to refurbished equipment deployment. EPCs could see schedule impacts, leading to more contingency allowances in contracts.

Scenario watch: modular approaches require stricter early-stage design coordination and carry change-order risk if site conditions differ from assumptions. Supply-chain benefits include factory-quality testing and reduced field commissioning time. However, transport logistics and on-site lifting capacity become gating factors for very large modules. Standardization of module interfaces could create economies of scale for OEMs that capture repeatable designs. What to monitor are bid packages that prefer modular delivery and any changes in insurance terms tied to factory-tested assemblies.
