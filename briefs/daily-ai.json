      "body": "Multiple indicators point to increased trials of machine learning models for load forecasting and congestion management. Vendors and system operators appear to be exchanging technical specifications and trial data sets more frequently. Expectations include modest near-term reductions in ancillary procurement volumes if models scale. Scenario watch: faster adoption could shift investment from peaker capacity to smarter grid controls. What to monitor are procurement notices for AI services and integration pilots with SCADA/EMS platforms. Supply-side implications include higher demand for high-reliability compute and communications at substations. Longer-term, successful pilots could compress peak procurement cycles and change reserve market design conversations. Operationally, operators may need tightened data governance and model validation processes. Financially, reduced reserve needs would alter capacity market signals in constrained regions.",
