This is framed as scenario risk rather than established fact, highlighting possible reserve shortfalls under extreme cold spells. Grid planners are expected to lean on faster-starting resources and demand response pilots as stopgaps. Investment in flexible capacity contracts and enhanced forecasting is being discussed in several planning sessions.

Modular GIS units promise smaller footprints and fewer on-site assembly hours, which align with tight permitting windows in urban and sensitive sites. Pilots are framed as expectations rather than widescale rollouts, with performance and lifecycle costs under observation. Supply-chain cadence for specialized components remains a critical variable in whether modularization yields time savings. EMV testing and protection coordination are focal points during pilot validation. The scenario suggests OEMs and EPCs could retool factories for modular assembly if pilots meet reliability and cost thresholds. What to monitor are procurement clauses referencing modular delivery and test results from pilot installations.",

This stacking approach can reduce peak draw while offering grid services during scarcity, but it also changes local protection and power quality demands. Distribution planners may need to reconsider hosting capacity and fault-level models when behind-the-meter fleets aggregate. The scenario could defer some transmission upgrades but increase distribution-level coordination complexity. Market structures that remunerate distributed flexibility will influence operator choices. Coordination protocols and telemetry standards become decisive in whether aggregated assets can safely provide grid services.
