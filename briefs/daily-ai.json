      "body": "Systems with high distributed energy resource penetration are showing signals of operational friction during peak cold snaps. The gap between measured distribution flows and ISO/TSO models is creating uncertainty in reserve scheduling. This uncertainty can force conservative procurement of ancillary services, raising system costs and reducing economic dispatch efficiency. Grid operators may lean on demand response programs but these can be uneven in coverage and reliability. In constrained areas, reliance on legacy thermal resources for inertia remains a contingency pathway, albeit with emissions and fuel-security considerations. Scenario planning should include correlated DER underperformance during extreme cold and communications latency issues. Expectations include temporary local voltage control interventions and re-prioritization of maintenance windows. What to monitor are telemetry anomalies from aggregated DER fleets and short-notice reserve activations.",

Aging fleets in several transmission corridors increase the likelihood of replacement needs clustering in time. Reduced spare inventories at utilities are a signal investors and planners should account for in contingency scenarios. Prolonged outages could cascade into load-shedding decisions if replacements or temporary substitutes are not available. EPCs are weighing temporary solutions like mobile substations, but deployment timelines and compatibility risks remain. The broader implication is a recalibration of maintenance prioritization toward preventive over deferred approaches. Expectations include accelerated condition assessments and pushing conditional spares procurement to higher priority.

The growing use of behind-the-meter resources may reduce peak demand exposure but also complicate distribution planning for utilities.
