      "body": "Grid operators are piloting orchestration stacks that aggregate thousands of behind-the-meter assets to provide capacity and ancillary services. These systems reduce central generation needs but introduce more failure modes at the distribution-to-transmission boundary. Fault isolation and protection coordination are areas of heightened risk as automated DER actions can change fault currents and reclosing behavior. There is increasing chatter about the need for live testing regimes that include protection vendors and DER aggregators. Software rollouts that alter DER response curves could produce unexpected demand patterns during peak events. Expect distribution operations teams to require new telemetry and faster visibility into aggregated DER states.",

The operational value is particularly compelling where staffing shortages limit on-site expertise. Digital twins also provide a controlled environment to simulate firmware updates and protection scheme changes with lower outage risk.

Long lead items create schedule risk for EPCs, forcing contingency plans or design changes to accept alternate transformer ratings. Extended delivery timelines also complicate spares strategies for operators aiming to maintain N-1 redundancy. There are signals of increased investment in modular transformer designs and relocation of production lines, but these will take years to materially change capacity. Some project owners are exploring retrofit options or phased energization to mitigate timeline exposure. The labor and raw steel inputs needed for faster scaling remain additional constraints.",
