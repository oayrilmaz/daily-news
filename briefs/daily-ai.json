      "body": "Signals from grid operators suggest elevated load growth in residential and commercial feeders where EV charging and heat-pump adoption are concentrated. Aging transformers on two- and three-decade-old feeders are a recurring constraint in these corridors. Operators may be running more manual switching and deploying temporary load transfers as stopgaps. Procurement cycles for new distribution transformers appear to be stretching, prompting contingency stock considerations. Scenario watch: if ambient temperature anomalies persist, thermal stress could accelerate failures on marginal assets. What to monitor are feeder-level loading curves, inventory reports for replacement transformers, and outage restoration times. Expect operational teams to prioritize dynamic load management and curtailable programs in stressed zones. Resource planning should consider expedited testing capacity for spare transformers and cross-region mutual aid readiness.",

The modular option shifts schedule risk upstream to manufacturers and logistics providers. Scenario watch: a spike in modular procurements could create new quality assurance bottlenecks if factory testing capacity is limited. Interface standards between modular units and legacy protection schemes remain an operational friction point. What to monitor are factory acceptance test availability, transport constraints for oversized modules, and substation protection relay compatibility. Operators should expect to invest more in integration testing and to update procurement language around factory QA. For planners, modular builds offer a route to faster interconnection but require tighter alignment on protection settings and secondary systems.",

That modeling raises questions about traditional UPS ride-through targets and generator sizing assumptions. Scenario watch: if AI clusters trigger more frequent high-power short events, some facilities may need to revisit battery energy storage sizing to avoid premature generator starts. Fuel supply and diesel storage permitting are emerging as operational constraints in dense data center regions. What to monitor are generator start cycles, UPS depth-of-discharge patterns, and fuel delivery outage risk windows.
