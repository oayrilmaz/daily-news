      "body": "Grid operators are reporting expectation signals rather than confirmed shortages, which should be treated as scenario inputs for system planners.\nNear-term weather volatility increases the probability band for colder-than-expected demand, pushing real-time protocols toward more conservative reserve margins.\nThis scenario elevates the value of fast-responding assets such as batteries, demand response, and quick-start thermal units.\nTransmission congestion in key load corridors increases the chance that local, not system-wide, reserve shortfalls become operational constraints.\nMarket participants are likely to see elevated ancillary service price volatility during stress windows, altering short-term dispatch incentives.\nEPCs and utilities should treat these signals as a risk vector for outage scheduling and for accelerated commissioning of flexible assets.\nLonger term, repeated winter tightness could accelerate investments in DER aggregation and grid-forming inverter deployments as system resiliency levers.\nPrepare for more frequent requests from operators for near-term availability data and for bilateral contracting of reserve-capable resources.",
