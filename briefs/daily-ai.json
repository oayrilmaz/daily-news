Operators appear to be prioritizing use cases that reduce manual switching and speed restoration in stressed areas. The emphasis is on modular AI components that can be isolated if they exhibit unexpected behavior. Expectations are for shorter pilot durations and tighter success metrics focused on stability and safety. Scenario watch: integration complexity with legacy EMS and SCADA remains the largest gating factor. What to monitor are procurement language changes that specify explainability and human-in-loop controls. Vendors are likely to respond with hardened deployment packages that limit autonomous authority. The net effect is an incremental but meaningful acceleration of AI into operational decision chains.",
