These deployments can improve responsiveness but also introduce new failure modes if models drift or training data reflects rare conditions poorly.

Expect vendors and integrators to issue tighter change-management protocols and rollback plans as a near-term mitigation. What to monitor are device-level logs, model retraining cadences, and any centralized orchestration changes that consolidate control. Cybersecurity and data integrity remain parallel risk dimensions; AI does not remove the need for defense-in-depth.
