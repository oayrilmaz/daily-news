      "body": "Industry conversations increasingly center on using AI to balance variability from wind and solar in near real time. Vendors and grid operators are reportedly experimenting with models that combine short-term forecasting and automated dispatching. These initiatives aim to reduce redispatch events and stabilize frequency without relying solely on conventional units. Expectations are that pilots will prioritize high-penetration feeders and microgrids where impact is measurable. There is a scenario watch that integration complexity and cybersecurity requirements could slow scalable deployments. Adoption will likely be incremental, framed as augmentation of existing SCADA and EMS systems. What to monitor are trial scopes, interoperability standards, and regulator signals on algorithmic accountability.",
