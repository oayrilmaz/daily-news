      "body": "Operators are reporting patterns consistent with reduced system inertia as synchronous generation retires and inverter-based resources grow. These patterns increase the frequency and magnitude of fast frequency events in modeled scenarios. Grid planners are flagging the need for synthetic inertia and faster primary frequency response to avoid load shedding during disturbances. Market designs that fail to compensate fast response create a risk of under-procurement of necessary services. System restoration procedures may need updating to account for low-inertia conditions and inverter ride-through limits. Expect contingency drills and revised service definitions in operator playbooks over the next 6–12 months. Vendors offering power electronics solutions are being watched for short-term deployable options. Integration complexity and inter-vendor interoperability remain an open scenario risk. Resource variability combined with dispatch practices could amplify stress during cold snaps or unexpected outages.",

Cybersecurity assessments are becoming a mandatory part of retrofit specifications in scenario planning. Contractors face labor and training bottlenecks when scaling retrofit work across large fleets. Supply-side constraints for modern relays and communication modules could slow rollout in some regions. Testing and validation windows will be critical to maintain operational reliability during staged upgrades. The scenario to monitor is misconfiguration-driven outages during phased deployments.",

This shift risks misaligning incentives for resources that provide seconds-to-minutes response.

System operators may need to introduce ancillary product refinements to avoid under-procurement of critical services. The structure of capacity auctions could advantage existing thermal plants unless fast-response assets can participate on competitive terms.
