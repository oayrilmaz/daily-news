      "body": "Grid operators are reportedly observing more frequent ramps and short-duration peaks as distributed energy resources cycle to balance volatile net load. This pattern elevates the importance of inverter behavior during high-frequency dispatch and under-frequency events. There is an expectation that legacy protection settings could interact unpredictably with rapid DER responses, creating localized reliability risks. Asset owners and operators may face harder choices between curtailment and protective margin expansion. Project planners should scenario-watch aggregator behavior and firmware update schedules for large DER fleets. Market mechanisms that reward sustained capacity rather than short bursts may be tested by this profile. Planning teams should model sub-minute dispatch dynamics and validate relay coordination under high inverter penetration. Operational exercises that simulate inverter trips during thermal congestion would reduce surprises during peak events.",

There is an expectation that refurbishment and in-country repair capabilities will see more near-term demand. Insurers and lenders may require revised risk mitigations tied to component availability.
