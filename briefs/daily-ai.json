Grid operators are likely to rely more on demand response windows and static reserves in near-term scenarios. Expectations include localized congestion on distribution feeders feeding large load pockets. Transmission-level contingencies could be triggered if multiple generation units face temperature or fuel issues. Market signals may propagate higher short-term prices in constrained zones, pressuring procurement teams. What to monitor are substation loading, feeder reconfigurations, and calls for emergency demand reductions. Scenario watch: a cold snap paired with low wind and curtailed imports could push reserve margins into critical ranges. Planners should model DER aggregation impacts and fast-acting load controls.",
