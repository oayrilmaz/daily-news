      "body": "Pilots using large models to synthesize weather, asset health, and market signals have shown potential to speed anomaly detection. These efforts are often exploratory and accompanied by increased scrutiny of data governance and model explainability. Signals from utilities indicate preference for human-in-the-loop configurations where AI flags events and operators validate actions. Expectation is that models will be used for situational awareness and not as direct control inputs for critical switching in the near term. Scenario watch should include adversarial testing and red-team exercises as attackers may target model inputs or training pipelines. What to monitor are incident response playbooks, vendor attestations on model integrity, and any changes to operational communication protocols. There is also a procurement angle: requests for proposals are beginning to ask for explainability and offline validation workflows. Vendors offering black-box models may lose traction unless they present robust verification layers.",

Expectations are that modular approaches will compress onsite construction windows and simplify integration testing. Scenario watch includes potential quality trade-offs if rapid scaling outpaces vendor capacity and skilled oversight. What to monitor are backlog notifications from Tier-1 suppliers and adoption rates of standardized module platforms. For EPCs, this trend changes cashflow profiles and warranty models, increasing the importance of factory QA programs. Utilities may adopt framework agreements with accelerated delivery clauses to retain flexibility. Operationally, modular substations could improve commissioning predictability but require robust transport and on-site handling plans.",
