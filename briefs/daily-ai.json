These tests are framed as expectations rather than confirmed operational failures. Results being circulated internally appear to favor adaptive, model-predictive controls that adjust setpoints in seconds. Vendors and system integrators are being asked to demonstrate firmware-level compatibility with these control paradigms. There is a scenario watch for multi-inverter interactions during low-inertia events that could amplify voltage oscillations. What to monitor are interconnection queue filings that specify inverter control capabilities and ride-through parameters. Procurement teams may shift to suppliers who provide proven dynamic models and co-simulation support. Longer term, jurisdictional standards could evolve to require synchronous-like response characteristics from inverter fleets.",

This is framed as expectation-setting rather than finalized procurement choices. The shift is driven by urban footprint limits and stricter building-code interpretations related to oil-filled units. Manufacturers of dry-type HV units are being asked for extended lead-time estimates and seismic qualification packages. Observations indicate potential supplier concentration, which raises sourcing risk for large orders. What to monitor are shortlists shared by EPCs and any rapid increases in lead-time notifications. The financial implications for projects may include higher upfront equipment cost but lower site civil and fire-suppression expenditures.
