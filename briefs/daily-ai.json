      "body": "Operators are piloting ML models that compress forecasting horizons and trigger automated dispatch adjustments. These models reduce forecast error on average but introduce the risk of correlated actions when multiple entities adopt similar algorithms. If many market participants react to the same model outputs, automated bids and resources can swing in the same direction, amplifying volatility. This raises a scenario watch for faster, larger swings in reserve activation and frequency response needs. System planners are reportedly testing mitigations like randomized decision buffers and diverse-model ensembles to avoid synchronized maneuvers. Market design implications include reviewing gate closure times and automated bid limits to reduce algorithmic feedback loops. Engineering teams should reassess protection coordination where faster resource ramping changes fault current and dynamic loading patterns.",

On-site oil handling, testing capacity, and transportation logistics are emerging bottlenecks when deploying refurbished or replacement units. Scenario watch includes higher incidence of extended outages if spares are unavailable or transport windows slip.

Storage co-located with PV is being used to smooth net load, but grid reinforcements lag in many areas. Inverter grid-forming capabilities are emerging as an operational response to low-inertia conditions and voltage stability challenges. Practical hurdles include firmware maturity, interoperability with existing protection schemes, and operator training on dynamic response modes. Scenario watch includes higher curtailment rates if inverter deployments follow older grid-following paradigms without accompanying control upgrades. Planning teams should update hosting-capacity analyses and accelerate pilots for grid-forming functions. Vendors may propose retrofit pathways for in-field inverter upgrades to unlock stability benefits without large capital reinforcement.",

Capacity prices may be more sensitive to assumption changes around forced outage rates and weather-driven demand spikes. Traders and asset operators are likely to reassess hedging positions in light of tighter modeled margins. Scenario watch includes price spikes if modeling updates are adopted near auction windows. There is pressure on aggregators and demand-response providers to demonstrate deliverable capacity under extreme conditions.
