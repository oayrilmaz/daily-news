      "body": "Signals show more system operators piloting ML-driven forecasts and automated dispatch aides as a way to reduce human workload and improve response times. Vendors are packaging pretrained prediction models with edge inferencing for substation and control-room use. Expectations are that near-term deployments will be hybrid: human-in-loop systems rather than full autonomy. Model drift from changing load patterns, new DERs, and weather extremes is a realistic scenario that can erode performance if not monitored. There are early indicators that teams lack standardized procedures for model validation and rollback in control settings. What to monitor are vendor update cadences, model explainability features, and vendor-provided safety nets. Utilities should plan governance for model lifecycle, including retraining triggers and real-time performance telemetry. A scenario watch: rapid scaling without governance could produce operational surprises during stress events. Integrating AI observability with existing SCADA telemetry is a pragmatic mitigation path.",

Modular dry-type and pad-mounted transformer options are being evaluated as stopgap and resilience measures, particularly for urban distribution reinforcements. EPCs are modeling site designs to accommodate modular components and simplified civil works to shorten delivery-to-commissioning timelines. Expectations include higher short-term O&M complexity as teams adapt to mixed fleets of traditional and modular devices. There is scenario risk around specifications mismatch when retrofitting legacy substations with modular units designed for different thermal profiles. What to monitor are lead-time advisories from manufacturers, logistics chokepoints at ports, and component obsolescence notices. Engineering teams should codify acceptance criteria for modular units to avoid commissioning delays. A near-term watch: accelerated local sourcing or factory expansion plans from vendors could ease pressures but require long procurement lead times.",

Expectations are that piloting will increase, with some campuses trialing hydrogen co-firing or fuel-cell backups alongside batteries to manage short-duration and long-duration events differently. There are uncertainties around hydrogen supply logistics, permitting, and retrofit complexity that could slow adoption. Vendors are advertising integrated microgrid packages to simplify developer procurement and reduce engineering scope. What to monitor are fuel supply agreements, local permitting timelines for hydrogen, and fuel-cell manufacturer warranties under load-following duty cycles.

There is tension between market signals that favor fast response and capacity mechanisms that reward duration and reliability. What to monitor are shifting market product designs for dispatchable capacity and penalties or incentives for curtailment.
