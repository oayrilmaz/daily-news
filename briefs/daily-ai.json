      "body": "Grid frequency excursions at sub-second scales are becoming a more visible scenario as inverter share grows. Operators are reporting higher reliance on fast-frequency response from inverters, but those resources vary by vendor settings and firmware. Expectations are that some balancing areas may test new operational limits during cold snaps or unplanned outages. Scenario watch includes localized underfrequency events that require emergency procurement of fast response reserves. Market mechanisms for procuring inertia-like services are unevenly defined across regions. The operational mix could force accelerated deployment of grid-forming inverters and synthetic inertia features. Implementation speed depends on vendor qualification cycles and utility procurement frameworks. The short-term risk window is concentrated around peak winter demand and during large scheduled outages of synchronous plants.",

The modular approach is framed as a hedge against skilled labor scarcity and restrictive permitting windows. Scenario expectations include more standardized designs and pre-qualified vendor lists to accelerate approvals.

There is a parallel signal that modular designs raise questions on site-specific protection coordination and adaptive relay settings.

Outcomes will depend on EPCs' ability to standardize interfaces without compromising system protection practices.

Grid studies are increasingly asking for dynamic reactive support and rapid ramp capabilities in interconnection requirements. The procurement challenge centers on revenue stacking across markets that were not designed for sub-hourly products.
