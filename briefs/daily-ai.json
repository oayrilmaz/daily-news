      "body": "Recent intelligence points to growing tension between fast-acting inverter controls and legacy frequency response schemes. System planners may face more frequent short-duration events where conventional governor-based responses are too slow or misaligned. This dynamic increases the chance of protective misoperations if settings are not reevaluated against inverter behavior. Expectations include heightened coordination needs between wind/solar plant controllers and regional protection engineers. Scenario watch: simultaneous curtailment and rapid recovery events that create power swings beyond current ride-through specifications. What to monitor are telemetry anomalies at plant and substation interfaces during high-variability periods. Operators should evaluate where adaptive protection and inertia-mimicking control logic could reduce contingency risk. The intelligence suggests proactive testing of islanding and black start sequences under inverter-dominated conditions.",

Scenario expectations include deferred capital projects and increased use of refurbishment and reconditioning to bridge gaps. EPCs are reportedly adjusting schedules and proposing modular or staged commissioning to mitigate schedule risk. What to monitor are contract clauses tied to raw-material escalation and long-lead retention commitments. The intelligence suggests a rising incidence of temporary autotransformer rentals or grid reconfiguration to sustain service.
