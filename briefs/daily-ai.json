      "body": "Grid operators are reporting increased instances of rapid ramp events coincident with high inverter output periods. These signals suggest existing protection and governor schemes may not be optimized for low-inertia conditions. Voltage oscillations at some substations are being managed by reactive support from legacy assets and limited fast-response storage. Frequency excursions remain within limits but show higher variance, increasing the probability of emergency remedial actions during extreme conditions. Protection miscoordination between legacy synchronous units and modern inverters is emerging as a recurring challenge. Operational teams are testing updated settings and ride-through parameters in simulation environments. Contingency planning now includes targeted activation of synchronous condensers or synthetic inertia outputs. Expect continued adjustments to market dispatch rules and ancillary product definitions as scenarios play out.",

Some system planners are re-prioritizing transmission reinforcements to key export nodes, but permitting and siting remain hurdles. Hybridization with storage is becoming a commercial hedge against curtailment risk but requires additional capital and interconnection capacity.
