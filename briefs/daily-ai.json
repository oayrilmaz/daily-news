Operators are reportedly cautious about model drift under seasonal loading changes and are layering human supervision. Scenario watch: if edge models maintain precision through load and temperature swings, rollout could accelerate to other feeder classes. What to monitor: increases in test scopes, procurement of qualified edge compute modules, and policy changes on relay certification.",
