Expectations include more frequent use of synthetic inertia and fast frequency response, especially where thermal generation retires. Grid operators may need new coordination protocols to align inverter control modes across vendors. OEMs and integrators face a scenario watch for interoperability tests and firmware harmonization demands. There is a parallel signal of increased interest in AI-driven state estimation to manage high converter penetration. What to monitor includes how ancillary service markets evolve to value fast, converter-based responses. Cybersecurity considerations rise as control layers become more software-defined. This shift implies capital planning changes and new workforce skill needs across utilities and EPCs.",

EPCs may see reduced on-site labor needs but increased factory testing workload. There is a scenario watch for supply chain concentration in key prefabrication yards that could become single points of failure. Equipment vendors could leverage modular standards to push services and long-term maintenance contracts. Regulators and utilities might demand updated test procedures for factory-assembled protection and control systems. What to monitor includes warranty language shifts and acceptance test checklists.

Transmission planners may need new studies to understand how electrochemical loads interact with seasonal variability. EPCs will be required to integrate multi-technology balance-of-plant and control systems. Market rules that value long-duration or seasonal storage could alter project bankability.
