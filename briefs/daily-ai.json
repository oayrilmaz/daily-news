Expectations include more frequent use of fast-start gas and demand response blocks during low-inertia intervals. Scenario watch: control-room automation and synthetic inertia deployment could mitigate but require rapid coordination changes. Market design frictions may slow dispatch of newer resources when visibility is limited. Ancillary service frameworks are being tested as traditional synchronous reserves decline. What to monitor: telemetry gaps between distribution-connected resources and system operators, and near-term procurement adjustments for minute-to-minute reserves. These dynamics suggest operational playbooks will be revised through winter stress events. Implementation risks center on telemetry standards, communications latency, and market settlement timelines.",
