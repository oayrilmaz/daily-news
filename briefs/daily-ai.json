These pilots are framed as technology risk-reduction steps rather than full migrations. What to monitor are integration pain points: data harmonization, latency, and vendor lock-in. Scenario modeling should assume phased adoption with hybrid human-AI control layers for the next 18–36 months. Procurement cycles may compress where pilots demonstrate measurable value, pressuring OEMs to offer bundled software-hardware solutions. Cybersecurity and governance controls are rising to the top of board-level considerations as more operational decision-making is algorithmically assisted. The economic implications include lower operating reserves in optimistic runs, but also new reliability contingency requirements.",
