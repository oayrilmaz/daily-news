The signal is an emphasis on real-time decisions across dispersed assets instead of single-point control. Early scenarios suggest improvements in arresting frequency excursions and reducing emergency reserves in simulated stress events. Implementation risks remain around model robustness, cyber posture, and interoperability with legacy SCADA. Regulatory frameworks are not uniformly prepared to recognize AI-driven synthetic inertia as a resource. What to monitor are test outcomes, rulemaking signals, and any staged deployments that would reveal scaling challenges. The overall scenario points to faster integration of software-led resilience if performance and oversight questions are resolved.",

Policy signals around export controls and investment screening could emerge as governments balance economic goals and strategic considerations. Environmental and social permitting is another uncertain vector that can delay projects.
