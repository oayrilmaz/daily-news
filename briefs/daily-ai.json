      "body": "Over the past quarters vendors and utilities have been testing ML models for anomaly detection, load forecasting, and automated dispatch recommendations. The near-term trajectory appears to favor point solutions that integrate into existing SCADA and EMS rather than wholesale replacement. Utilities that are risk-averse are reportedly staging AI behind human-in-the-loop workflows to preserve operator control and auditability. There is a growing emphasis on explainability, model versioning, and data lineage as prerequisites for any broader rollouts. Vendor consolidation could accelerate once a handful of field-proven stacks demonstrate reliability in high-consequence scenarios. Expect slower adoption where legacy control systems lack standardized telemetry or where procurement rules inhibit rapid change. The scenario to monitor is a cluster of regional operators adopting similar AI modules, which would create operational interdependencies and shared cyber risk vectors.",

Longer lead times could compress project schedules and elevate contingency spending for temporary generation or load management. Smaller utilities with limited warehousing capacity face heightened operational risk if a critical unit fails.
