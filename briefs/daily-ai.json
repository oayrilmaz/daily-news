This is prompting scenario work that weighs faster, lower-inertia events against traditional thermal-driven contingencies. The intelligence posture is that control strategy updates and procurement of synthetic inertia or fast frequency response services will move higher on near-term agendas. Planners may prioritize telemetry, local autonomous controls, and new protection schemes to manage tighter margins. Vendors and OEMs could see shifted requirements for inverters, including grid-forming capability and enhanced ride-through specifications. What to monitor are signals from transmission operators and balancing authorities about revising operating limits or service procurements. There is an expectation that integration costs and operational complexity will rise temporarily as systems adapt. Scenario watch: accelerated procurement of fast-response services could strain market design and create cross-jurisdictional coordination challenges.",
