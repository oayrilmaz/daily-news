      "body": "Operators are increasingly piloting AI models to forecast net load and dispatch inverter-based resources with sub-hour cadence. These pilots are producing signals that reserve procurement windows and ancillary service products could be restructured. What to monitor is whether model-driven dispatch reduces reliance on traditional spinning reserves or merely shifts risk profiles. Scenario watch: faster forecasting may compress lead times for response but amplify consequences of model failure. Integration friction is likely at transmission-distribution interfaces where interoperability standards remain partial. Vendors are framing AI as a reliability enabler, but deployment timelines are uneven across regions. Expect debates on verification, testing, and operator override protocols to intensify. The near-term material change is more in operational practice and procurement plans than in physical infrastructure.",
