      "body": "Multiple technology and vendor signals suggest utilities are accelerating trials of AI-driven control layers to coordinate DERs and storage during peak events. The framing here is one of operational risk management rather than wholesale replacement of human dispatch. Expectations center on incremental deployments that sit above existing SCADA and EMS systems to provide probabilistic dispatch recommendations. These orchestration layers emphasize improved state estimation, short-term congestion forecasts, and automated remedial action suggestions. Scenario watch: faster adoption could shift reserve procurement patterns and reduce real-time price spikes in some markets. What to monitor are integration choices, vendor footprints, and whether operators lean on closed ecosystems or open standards. Technical risk remains in model explainability and safe fallback behaviors during anomalous system states.",

The intelligence framing highlights schedule risk reduction as the primary driver rather than cost parity. Scenario watch: wider adoption could shift labor needs toward site integration teams and increase demand for standard protection/control packages. What to monitor is whether utilities accept design-standardization tradeoffs and how interconnection studies account for modular deployment. There is a secondary supply-chain effect as manufacturers adapt production lines for modular assemblies.
