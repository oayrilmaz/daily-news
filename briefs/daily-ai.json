      "lede": "Operational signals point to a scenario where distributed energy resources (DERs) are being called on more often to support winter demand peaks, raising questions about coordination and visibility.",
      "body": "Grid operators appear to be adjusting dispatch patterns to lean on DERs during cold snaps. This is producing operational frictions where visibility into aggregated DER states is limited. The scenario suggests rising reliance on behind-the-meter assets to manage peak loads. That reliance could expose gaps in telemetry and control standardization across aggregators. Vendors and utilities may accelerate investments in telemetry gateways to reduce uncertainty. If dispatch frequency continues, expect more formalized participation rules for DERs in ancillary services. Market design friction remains a likely near-term outcome. Coordination between distribution operators and ISOs is a scenario watch for operational continuity.",

The scenario reflects an operational preference to minimize forced outages and speed maintenance cycles. OEMs may respond by reallocating manufacturing capacity toward modular designs, increasing lead times for traditional large units. Logistics constraints and specialized transport needs for novel modular skids are likely to emerge. The pressure could create an ordering rush ahead of peak maintenance seasons. EPC planners should model alternative timelines and pre-qualify modular options. Expect procurement teams to seek flexible contracts that allow partial deliveries to support phased replacements.",

However, logistics and transport infrastructure remain limiting factors in the near term. Permitting and regulatory timelines are likely to shape which projects reach production first. Downstream processors and battery manufacturers may prioritize long-term offtake agreements to secure supply.
