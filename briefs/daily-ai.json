These signals do not confirm outages but increase the probability space for reserve activations and short-duration interventions. Operators may lean on ancillary markets and demand-response programs more aggressively in the near term. Fuel supply dynamics for gas-fired units could widen the impact if delivery constraints coincide with peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks into high-load corridors remain a critical scenario driver that would amplify localized stress. Emergency restoration timelines could be extended by transformer spare shortages if forced outages occur. What to monitor: reserve margin updates, dispatchable fuel inventories, and short-term market price spikes.",
