      "body": "Multiple technology and operations signals suggest AI models are being tested to smooth intra-day dispatch and fast-ramping resources. These pilots are framed as decision-support rather than autonomous control, yet operational reliance is increasing in stressful conditions. Assimilation of AI outputs into human workflows is uneven across control rooms, raising scenario risks around operator over-reliance. Data quality and latency constraints remain the primary limiting factor for broad rollouts, especially at transmission scale. Cyber-hardened model deployment practices are emerging but are not yet standardized across regions. Expectation: increased procurement language for explainability and audit trails in near-term contracts. What to monitor: whether grid codes begin to require model governance or third-party model verification. This is an intelligence view, not a claim of widespread deployment, and should be treated as scenario-driven guidance.",

This mixed-architecture posture increases complexity for both protection coordination and incident response.

There is an observable push toward standardized hardware-module replacements in procurement signals.
