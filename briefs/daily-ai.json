      "body": "Multiple pilot programs are reportedly focused on day‑ahead and intra‑day dispatch optimization using ML ensembles. These pilots aim to capture flexibility from demand response and batteries without creating new single points of failure. Validation and explainability of models remain a recurring scenario risk when models encounter extreme weather or atypical market conditions. Auditing procedures and model governance are emerging as critical operational controls in these experiments. There is expectation that vendors will push packaged AI tools while operators demand stronger transparency and failure-mode testing. The current landscape favors hybrid approaches that keep human-in-the-loop decision authority for contingency events. Longer term, successful pilots could alter reserve procurement and short-term markets, but adoption appears likely to be staged and regionally uneven.",

There is an expectation that modular builds will first scale in urban and constrained sites where footprint and outage windows are primary drivers.
