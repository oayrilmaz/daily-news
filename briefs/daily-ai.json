Vendors are testing hierarchical control stacks that combine local autonomy with centralized dispatch signals.\nInteroperability and cybersecurity remain central concerns as more endpoints connect to operational networks. The intelligence view is that incremental upgrades to control layers will be the near-term response rather than wholesale replacements.\nMarket design frictions for fast capacity and distribution-level ancillary services are expected to influence how DERs are compensated and dispatched. Expect pilot programs and tariff experiments in regions with high DER growth.\nLabor and skills are a secondary constraint; utilities may prioritize remote commissioning and digital twins to reduce on-site engineer hours.

Recycling flows are part of the resilience calculus.\nThere is an intelligence signal to anticipate contracting shifts: more bilateral agreements with manufacturers, earlier procurement cadences, and multi-year supply commitments. OEMs may prioritize large contractual work.\nField logistics and siting for spare transformers are operational details receiving renewed scrutiny.
