These systems are frequently run in advisory mode rather than full automation, which maintains human-in-the-loop controls but raises latency and decision-friction questions. Operators are balancing faster decision aids with outline procedures for override and audit trails. Cybersecurity considerations are emerging as critical as model inputs and outputs span OT and IT domains. Training data quality and scenario coverage are recurring constraints noted in pilot feedback. Procurement groups are now factoring model integration and lifecycle support into RFPs. Expect incremental reliability benefits, but also new failure modes tied to model errors and integration misconfigurations.",
