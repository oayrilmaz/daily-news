      "body": "Telemetry and anecdotal operational reports point to more frequent peak events during off-peak hours in several systems. These events are not yet systemic failures but represent early indicators of capacity tightness under new load shapes. The combination of long-duration electrification loads and high-density short-duration AI loads complicates reserve planning. There is an expectation that reserve margins will be reassessed in some regions over the coming quarters. Grid operators may start prioritizing dynamic rather than static capacity products to handle variability. Market mechanisms and procurement practices are both likely to come under review as these signals persist. Scenario watch: stretching of reserves during concurrent cold snaps and AI-driven training cycles could expose weak nodes ahead of formal planning responses.",

Replacement lead times for large power transformers are being reported as lengthening, creating an environment where failures could have longer repair windows. There is an expectation that asset owners will shift toward preemptive inventory and spares strategies to reduce exposure. OEMs and EPCs may receive more aggressive RFIs for accelerated delivery, increasing pressure on factory capacity.
