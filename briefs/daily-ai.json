      "body": "Signals show multiple pilot programs exploring model-predictive control for mixed fleets of renewables, storage, and thermal plants. These pilots are framed as experiments to improve balancing and reduce ramp costs without replacing human oversight. Expectations include faster recognition of emerging constraints but also a greater need for model governance and explainability. Scenario watch highlights the potential for compressed decision cycles that could challenge existing control-room procedures and regulatory frameworks. What to monitor are integration points between AI stacks and protection/SCADA layers where latency or misconfiguration could cascade. Cybersecurity posture is a recurring theme; operators are evaluating isolation, fail-safe modes, and manual override policies. Vendors and system integrators are positioning products for hybrid human-AI workflows rather than full autonomy. The near-term intelligence signal favors targeted pilots and gradual scope expansion rather than wholesale operational handoff.",
