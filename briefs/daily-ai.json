      "body": "Seasonal demand volatility appears to be intersecting with a growing share of non-synchronous generation on distribution feeders. This combination is testing conventional load-forecast models that assume inertia and predictable ramping behavior. Operators are evaluating short‑horizon AI-assisted forecasting to fill gaps in existing market dispatch tools. There are expectations that automated remedial action schemes and tighter coordination with DER aggregators will be more frequently used. Contingency scenarios include faster-than-expected frequency excursions on weakened local grids and increased reliance on distributed storage dispatch. What to monitor are pilot results from near-real-time forecasting trials and any operational notices that tighten ramp or reserve requirements. These developments could prompt accelerated procurement of fast-response reserves and communications upgrades. Equipment owners should consider scenario testing for protection settings and DER inverter ride-through behavior.",

There are expectations that utilities will weigh repair-and-reuse approaches against complete replacement to manage timelines. Technical trade-offs for SF6 alternatives include equipment footprint and testing regime changes, which can affect substation layouts.

This approach shifts some reliance away from third-party UPS-only strategies toward broader plant-level energy management. Scenario watch includes slower interconnection timelines for new transmission-dependent power purchase agreements and tighter local permitting for large gensets.

This has led to localized voltage management challenges and the prospect of increased curtailment during low-load periods. Operators are expected to explore tariff redesigns that better reflect the cost of constrained hosting capacity. There are scenario watch indicators of more aggressive active power curtailment and voltage control mandates for inverters. What to monitor are technical notices on inverter reactive-power settings and modified interconnection agreements. Developers face the risk of lower contracted volumes or stepped commercial terms tied to curtailment exposure. Grid-scale storage and dynamic line rating deployments are being considered as mitigations where transmission upgrades lag.

There are expectations of higher clearing prices in some regional auctions if fast-response resources remain thin. Grid operators may lean on emergency demand reductions and voluntary curtailment signals as interim measures. Scenario watch includes greater participation by aggregated DERs and storage in capacity products, potentially altering price formation. What to monitor are auction participation rates and qualification of non-traditional capacity resources.
