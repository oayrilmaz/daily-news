      "body": "Grid operators and control-room teams are increasingly deploying AI to optimize dispatch, detect faults, and automate remedial actions. These systems generate new operational signals that differ from traditional human-derived indicators, creating a gap between expected and observed behavior. Expectations are that automation will reduce routine errors but could accelerate atypical responses when input data deviates from training distributions. Scenario watch: simultaneous marginal mispredictions across correlated assets could compress response windows. What to monitor are model drift indicators, retraining cadences, and any instances of automated control overrides. The interplay between AI recommendations and human operator acceptance is a critical driver in near-term risk. Planning assumptions should include degraded observability during extreme events and the potential need for manual fallback modes. This is an intelligence framing to prepare operators for new modes of failure rather than a claim of specific incidents.",
