      "body": "Operators running AI-assisted dispatch and asset health pilots report inconsistent telemetry cadence and missing metadata as recurring friction points. These gaps limit model generalization and increase the risk of false positives in anomaly detection. Teams are exploring middleware and standardized data schemas to create consistent pipelines between field devices and model inference layers. There is an expectation that vendors will propose lightweight gateways to harmonize telemetry without full SCADA replacement. Scenario watch: delays to gateway deployments could push AI ops timelines into multi-year horizons for some utilities. What to monitor are RFP language changes requesting data schema compliance and middleware procurement activity. If procurement shifts toward integrated telemetry services, smaller OEMs may face competitive pressure. This signal should prompt asset managers to prioritize data mapping exercises now to avoid later integration costs.",

Some utilities are emphasizing standardized test benches and factory acceptance test (FAT) scripts to reduce onsite work.
