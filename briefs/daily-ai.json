      "body": "Multiple operational teams are testing AI models to smooth dispatch between thermal, battery, and inverter-fed renewables. These pilots aim to reduce human operator load during rapid ramps driven by weather and forecast error. Signals suggest models improve short-term scheduling but struggle with cross-area contingencies and rare equipment failures. Expectations are that AI will be used initially in advisory modes rather than automated control loops. Scenario watch includes model degradation after unseen plant behavior and the need for human override protocols. What to monitor: model confidence outputs, operator acceptance rates, and near-real-time telemetry gaps. There is also a governance signal: utilities are drafting standard operating procedures for AI recommendations. The interplay of market signals and AI decisions could create unintended dispatch feedbacks in stressed conditions.",

EPCs report longer queue times for factory acceptance tests and shipping, particularly for medium-voltage assemblies. Scenario watch indicates some operators may defer retrofits and instead increase monitoring of existing SF6 systems. There's an expectation that maintenance windows will be squeezed as utilities align retirements and retrofits with outage seasons. Risk signals include mismatches between statutory phase-down timelines and available equipment. What to monitor: supplier backlog notices, certification completions for replacement technologies, and grid operator mitigation plans. In parallel, repurposed used switchgear markets are expanding as stop-gap options, though lifecycle risks are elevated. Decision makers are weighing incremental emissions compliance against near-term reliability exposure.",

There are operational signals that UPS and cooling strategies are being re-engineered for higher dynamic loads. Market pricing for capacity and delivery of large power transformers is tightening.

There's a signal that merchant battery projects may receive better near-term revenue outlooks, but also face higher capital costs due to supply-chain premiums. Expect volatility in short-term markets as operators dispatch from thermal and fast-response resources.

There are signals that some contractors are increasing the use of local partnerships to meet content thresholds while preserving technical capability. What to monitor: permit adjudication timelines, local-sourcing certification documentation, and any temporary relief or grandfathering clauses in legislation.
