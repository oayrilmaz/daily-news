      "body": "Operators are beginning to layer probabilistic AI optimization on top of existing dispatch and outage planning workflows. Expectations center on shorter response times and more aggressive redispatch under complex contingencies. The intelligence framing here is that optimization gains come with harder-to-interpret decision logic that may conflict with relay and protection assumptions. Scenario watch should focus on near-term incidents where automated reconfiguration interacts with manual protections. Engineering teams will likely need expanded test harnesses and explainability checks to validate AI decisions against N-1/N-2 criteria. Vendors are expected to move toward certified integration kits and modular simulation endpoints to close the validation gap. What to monitor are pilot test results and any supplier-specified safeguards that change protection settings or operator override windows.",

The intelligence angle is that prefabrication shifts the bottleneck upstream to major components, particularly large power transformers. Scenario watch centers on whether modular approaches will trigger early procurement of transformers or increased specification flexibility to accept alternative units. EPCs may adopt standardized secondary systems to allow transformer delivery swaps without full redesign. Manufacturers appear to be prioritizing factory capacity for higher-margin standard units, which could leave bespoke high-MVA units on longer queues. Project owners are likely to seek contractual remedies and earlier supplier commitments. Monitor supplier cadence announcements and procurement patterns for signs of near-term schedule adjustments.",

The intelligence view is that inverter availability will be a near-term gate on project commissioning dates.

Grid operators may prioritize firm capacity projects when scheduling constraints are acute, increasing merchant exposure.
