Early deployments report improved detection of cascading conditions but also instances where model recommendations conflicted with operator judgment. Data quality issues—missing SCADA streams and sensor calibration drift—are recurring conditions that reduce model reliability. There is growing attention on how automations escalate to human oversight and how rollback procedures function under time pressure. Scenario watch: if model confidence thresholds are mis-set during peak events, automated actions could inadvertently alter protection coordination. What to monitor are incident logs, model retraining cadences, and the emergence of standardized governance frameworks among grid operators.",
