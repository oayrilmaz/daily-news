      "body": "Multiple operational signals suggest regional grid operators are testing AI layers to assist in real-time balancing and congestion management. These trials are framed as augmenting human dispatchers rather than replacing them, but scenarios show potential for faster automated actions under stress. Vendors are pitching model-driven dispatch and contingency ranking as ways to squeeze more capacity from constrained networks. That approach could improve short-term reliability but introduces model-risk and explainability requirements that operators may not be fully equipped to audit. Cybersecurity teams are flagging expanded attack surfaces as AI agents access SCADA and EMS systems. Regulators in some jurisdictions are expected to ask for vendor transparency and third-party model validation. Expect a phased rollout where human-in-the-loop safeguards remain until proven at scale.",

Procurement language in recent tenders reportedly emphasizes lifecycle emissions and ease of retrofit. EPCs are proposing modular upgrade packages to reduce outage windows and workforce exposure. The transition will face supply chain friction, particularly around non-SF6 switchgear availability and trained installation crews.
