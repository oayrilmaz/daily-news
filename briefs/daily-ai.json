These exercises are framed as scenario testing rather than confirmed operational changes, but they indicate an elevated focus on edge-case performance. Staff-level discussions appear to be emphasizing model explainability and fallback manual controls in case automated dispatch signals diverge from human judgement. There is an expectation that near-term iterations will prioritize ingestion of weather and fuel-security signals to reduce false positives.
