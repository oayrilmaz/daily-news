Inverter-based resources are providing capacity but not the same inertia and ramping characteristics as synchronous units, raising balancing complexity. Grid controllers may need to retain more fast-start units and demand-response activations to assure reliability during peak evening ramps. Market volatility could increase as scarcity pricing events become more likely in constrained areas. Transmission bottlenecks between regions could force re-dispatch and curtailment scenarios for some renewable-rich zones. System operators and utilities should be preparing contingency dispatch sequences and testing communication paths with distributed resources.",

Utility upgrade cycles for transformers and conductor capacity remain constrained by capital budgets and permitting lead times.

Higher commodity price volatility may increase the relative attractiveness of low-marginal-cost renewables and storage, but also raises short-term hedging complexity for thermal asset owners. Regulatory signals about carbon accounting and potential tightening of allowances increase the risk profile for fossil-heavy portfolios.
