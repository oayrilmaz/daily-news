These signals suggest faster depletion of ancillary reserves and a greater reliance on fast-start resources. Expect near-term operational trade-offs between maintaining reliability and managing equipment thermal stress. Scenario watch should include cascading constraints where a single contingency elevates multiple flowgates. What to monitor are reserve utilization rates, emergency procurement notices, and any changes to operating limits. Planning teams should model sequential outages under low-temperature ambient conditions. Consider accelerated checks on protective relays and thermal ratings for critical lines. Operational messaging to stakeholders should emphasize conditional expectations rather than definitive forecasts.",
