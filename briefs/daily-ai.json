These ramp events appear correlated with intermittent renewable output swings and distributed electric heating use. Grid operators and planners may increasingly treat fast-response storage as a hedge instrument rather than solely a capacity resource. Expectations include a rise in short-duration ancillary service procurements and more granular state-estimator updates. Scenario watch: constrained corridors might force localized re-dispatch and increase reliance on demand response. What to monitor are reserve activations, battery charge-discharge cycles, and feeder-level thermal alarms. Grid planners should incorporate these signal-driven stress patterns into near-term outage and contingency planning.",
