      "body": "Grid operators are reporting more frequent short-duration frequency excursions consistent with higher shares of inverter-based generation. These signals are not definitive failures but represent an operational trend that stresses conventional tools for frequency control. Scenario watch centers on whether procurement of synthetic inertia and fast frequency response will become standard in near-term capacity markets. OEMs and EPCs face demand signals for firmware upgrades and grid-forming inverter functions. Transmission planners may need to re-evaluate contingency assumptions in planning models. There is an expectation that markets could price new fast-acting services differently, creating revenue opportunities and interoperability demands. What to monitor are procurement notices and interconnection studies that reference grid-forming capabilities.",
