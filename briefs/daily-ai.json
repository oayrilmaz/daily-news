Grid models are being adjusted to reflect increased behind-the-meter responses and inverter-driven behaviour. Expectations include more frequent deployment of emergency protocols for localized congestion. Scenario watch: multiple DER aggregations interacting with islanding events could complicate restoration sequences. Fuel-delivery windows for thermal plants remain a key uncertainty in many basins. What to monitor are reserve activation notices, localized frequency excursions, and DER aggregator telemetry.
