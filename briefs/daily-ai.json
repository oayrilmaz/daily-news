These trials are framed as compensating measures rather than replacements for established protection. Early expectations center on improved frequency response and fewer manual dispatch interventions during fast ramp events. There is scenario risk where imperfect models amplify transients unless conservative fallbacks are enforced. A near-term watch is whether operators scale from advisory to closed-loop control within 12–24 months. Industry suppliers are balancing software licensing with retrofits for legacy inverters. What to monitor are validation metrics, rollback procedures, and regulatory comfort with automated actions.",
