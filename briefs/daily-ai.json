These discrepancies have appeared more often during temperature swings and rapid charge-discharge cycles. Operators may be seeing increased alarm rates that do not always correlate with equipment failure. Scenario watch: drift could degrade dispatch accuracy and reduce available reserve margins if uncorrected. Expectations are that firmware patches and recalibration campaigns will be prioritized where telemetry shows repeated patterns. What to monitor: frequency of state-estimation corrections, firmware versions in the field, and vendor advisories. The operational impact is likely manageable short term but could increase maintenance windows and constraint risk in summer peak scenarios. This is an intelligence signal rather than a confirmed widespread failure trend.",

Scenario watch: deferred oil changes raise the risk profile for incremental failures during thermal stress events. What to monitor includes lead times from known suppliers, inventory levels at key service providers, and any preferential allocation for critical infrastructure. The intelligence point is advisory; it does not assert system-wide shortages. Planning adjustments and prioritization frameworks are prudent to mitigate operational exposure.",

Expectations include modest pricing dispersion across grades and possible delays for specialty oxide concentrates.
