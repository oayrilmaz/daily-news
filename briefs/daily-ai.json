      "body": "Grid planners report increasing periods where traditional inertial response is insufficient relative to ramping and contingency scenarios. These dynamics are not uniform; they concentrate in regions with rapid solar and wind buildouts paired with retirements of synchronous generators. In several operational areas, short-duration frequency excursions appear more frequent in simulated and observed events, raising expectations for faster-acting controls. Operators are testing grid-forming inverter modes and synchronous condenser deployments as mitigations. Market designs are under pressure to recognize fast-ramping reserves and new ancillary service products. Coordination between transmission planners and distribution-connected DER aggregators is an emerging area of friction. Scenario watch: if ramping events cluster during extreme weather, reserve margins could tighten faster than procurement cycles allow.",
