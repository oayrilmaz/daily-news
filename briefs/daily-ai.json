Expectations are that near-term trials will stress interoperability with legacy SCADA and protection relays. Scenario watch: mismatches between AI recommendations and protective relay settings could generate operational friction and conservative manual overrides. Operators are likely to proceed with staged rollouts to preserve N-1 reliability while collecting validation data. There is a pragmatic focus on human-in-the-loop controls, with AI suggested actions flagged for operator confirmation. Procurement teams should assess vendor claims against test datasets and interoperability checklists. What to monitor are vendor model explainability, latency under real telemetric loads, and contingency-mode fallback behavior.",

OEMs are signaling constrained factory capacity, which could prioritize customers with volume commitments. Field operations teams may need updated asset management plans that incorporate refurbishment windows and rotational spares.
