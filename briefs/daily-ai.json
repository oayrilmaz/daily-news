This is generating expectations that standard winter peaks could be amplified by electrification loads in the coming weeks. System operators may face localized ramp-rate pressures as batteries and demand response attempt to smooth short-duration spikes. Generation availability signals are mixed, with some thermal units showing higher forced outage probabilities in cold snaps. Transmission constraints around major metropolitan interties could create localized price spikes and force re-dispatch. Ancillary services usage patterns are trending up, implying tighter reserve margins.
