These signals point to an effective inertia deficit as synchronous plant availability declines. Grid control centers are testing new reserve heuristics and tighter governor control windows in simulations. Protection engineers are flagging miscoordination risks between legacy relays and modern power-electronics responses. There is an expectation that temporary operating procedures may be issued to maintain N-1 security during extreme ramps.
