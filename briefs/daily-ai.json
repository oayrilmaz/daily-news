These pilots are framed as operational experiments rather than full production rollouts, signaling caution. The main intelligence line is that AI can compress decision cycles and surface non-obvious dispatch options during rapid ramps. If models are scaled without rigorous boundary checks, there is an expectation of increased operational complexity rather than simplification. What to monitor are rule-change filings and telemetry patterns around peaker and battery dispatch. Short-term outcomes will hinge on human-in-the-loop procedures and model explainability.",
