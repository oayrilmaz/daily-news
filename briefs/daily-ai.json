      "lede": "Signals point to an accelerating interest among regional operators in AI orchestration for real-time distributed energy resource (DER) control as a way to shave peaks and defer transmission upgrades.",
      "body": "Operators are testing scenario-based AI agents to manage aggregated DERs under contingency conditions. These pilots frame AI as a decision support layer rather than an autonomous controller in most cases. Expectations are that trials will emphasize safety margins and human-in-the-loop overrides for at least the next 12–18 months. The intelligence framing sees two near-term pathways: enhanced grid visibility via telemetry and incremental DER dispatch authority granted under constrained conditions. Watch for condition-based activation logic and contractual adjustments with DER aggregators. Procurement teams may shift to controls that support secure, low-latency APIs. Policy units are likely to demand auditable logs before granting operational permissions. The scenario watch is that successful pilots could reduce immediate demand for certain transmission reinforcements, but longer-term capacity needs may remain.",

Storage economics in these models hinge on both energy arbitrage and ancillary service revenue streams. Grid operators are likely to pilot dynamic curtailment pricing to balance local constraints.
