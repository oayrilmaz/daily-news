Expectations include faster decision loops for congestion relief and reserve activation, but also new dependencies on data pipelines. Scenario watch: degraded input streams or biased training sets could produce suboptimal dispatch signals during stressed conditions. What to monitor are retraining cadences, validation datasets, and human override policies. Vendors are signaling packaged solutions that blur R&D and production lines, raising questions about lifecycle management. There are implications for protection coordination if AI-driven setpoints change more frequently. Prepare for audits of model performance and traceability as part of compliance and reliability reviews.",
