      "body": "Several utilities and vendors appear to be moving beyond algorithmic proofs of concept toward near-real-time models that feed operational decision-making. These models are being pitched to predict fault likelihood, prioritize crew dispatch, and forecast restoration timelines. Expectations include improved situational awareness during cascading events and better resource optimization. Scenario watch centers on false positives and model drift when faced with rare event conditions. What to monitor are early operational metrics: prediction lead time, accuracy under weather stress, and human override frequency. Integration friction with existing SCADA and outage management systems is a recurring signal. Contractual implications include SLAs tied to forecast reliability and vendor liability clauses. Cybersecurity of model pipelines is emerging as a gate for wider adoption. Vendors may push appliance-style offerings to simplify deployments. The pace at which utilities update training data and feedback loops will determine practical gains.",

Expectations include longer planning horizons for retrofits as owners weigh lifecycle costs and retrofit complexity. Scenario watch focuses on lead-time variability for SF6-free equipment and compatibility with existing buswork and protection schemes. What to monitor are procurement notes that require SF6 alternatives or limit SF6 usage in tender documents. Technical interoperability and the need for additional control cubicle retrofits are recurring planning signals. EPC firms may propose phased replacement approaches to manage capital and outage windows.

What to monitor are tariffs and interconnection constraints that enable or block dual-use of storage. Thermal management, safety standards, and warranty alignment with high-cycle use present engineering challenges. Data center uptime requirements drive conservative dispatch strategies initially, limiting revenue capture.

Expectations are for longer queue timelines as host circuits reach thermal and dynamic stability limits. Scenario watch includes re-prioritization of projects based on deliverability and system needs rather than first-come paperwork. What to monitor are system studies that add mitigation costs or require network upgrades. EPC timelines may lengthen if transmission reinforcements are required, pushing financing and COD dates. Grid operators could start to favor projects that offer grid support functions like inertia emulation and synthetic frequency response.

Settlement design and measurement windows will materially influence dispatch behavior and investment signals. Capacity market reforms could accelerate investment in dispatchable storage and flexible demand controls. Market participants may pursue hedging strategies to smooth revenue volatility.
