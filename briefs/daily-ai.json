Observations point to more pilots linking residential and commercial DERs into aggregated capacity markets during peak intervals. Frequency services from aggregated behind-the-meter assets are being tested in parallel with traditional spinning reserves. Stakeholders are weighing interoperability and telemetry burdens against the speed benefits of DER activation. There is also a practical concern about settlement and verification for short-duration response events. Procurement windows and tariff structures may need rapid adjustments to reflect these operational experiments. What to monitor are operation notices, pilot enrollment figures, and any short-term tariff changes that favor aggregation.",

Observers note that factory assembly offers predictable quality controls and easier staging in constrained sites. There are trade-offs related to transportation, civil interfaces, and local certification that remain under discussion. EPCs are evaluating standardization benefits against bespoke site needs that still require field engineering. The scenario to watch is a shift in tender language favoring kit-based scope options in upcoming notices. That would accelerate a shift in supply-chain practices but could also reveal bottlenecks in specialized transport and secondary equipment lead times. Monitoring delivery windows and clause language in new tenders will be important for manufacturers and installers.",
