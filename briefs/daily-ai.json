      "body": "Multiple jurisdictions are testing AI-driven dispatch and protection coordination to optimize constrained corridors. These systems can reduce human workload and improve economic dispatch under normal conditions. However, the integration layer between AI agents and existing protection schemes remains shallow in many deployments. That gap creates a scenario where automated corrective actions interact unpredictably with legacy trip logic during stressed events. Model drift and unseen edge cases may amplify small errors into cascading outages if not mitigated. Operators are being advised to maintain conservative fail-safes and to model multi-agent interactions in system studies. Contingency planning should include manual override protocols and staged rollouts to limit systemic exposure.",

Pilots suggest operators prefer hybrid setups that combine batteries with limited genset capacity. This reduces black-start dependency and diesel inventory needs under many scenarios.

However, storage lifecycle and recycling considerations introduce new supply-chain dependencies. Grid planners should expect localized shifts in net load shape where large campuses deploy storage.

This can lower peak prices in some auctions while creating lumpy availability in others. Market operators are grappling with visibility into aggregated assets' firmness and correlated failure modes.
