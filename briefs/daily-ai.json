      "body": "Operators are reporting higher-than-normal reserve activations in multiple control areas, prompting exploratory use of AI forecasting to refine short-term unit commitment. The signals suggest AI models are being evaluated for real-time anomaly detection and to prioritize dispatchable resources. This remains in a pilot and evaluation phase for many entities, with adoption hinging on model explainability and regulatory acceptance. Scenario watch highlights that if pilots reduce reserve burn by measurable margins, procurement and operating guidelines could shift rapidly. Integration challenges persist around data quality, latency, and operator trust in model recommendations. What to monitor are changes in operating procedures and any regulatory guidance loosening on automated decision support.",

The scenario watch is that extended lead times will push operators toward maintaining larger on-site spares inventories. Financial and storage constraints mean not every utility can scale spares, creating uneven exposure across regions. This increases the likelihood of multi-week outages if critical assets fail and replacement procurement is delayed. OEM capacity expansion plans are reportedly in evaluation, but those would only address medium-term needs. Near-term mitigation options include conditional repairs, dynamic reconfiguration, and cross-utility mutual aid frameworks.",
