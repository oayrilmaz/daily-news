Studies and field exercises are being framed as scenario watch items to adjust protection settings, synthetic inertia schemes, and fault-ride-through configurations. The scarcity of traditional synchronous sources is creating expectations for more conservative operating limits in stressed regions. Vendors are fielding requests for firmware updates and new control modes rather than replacement transformers or breakers in the short term. Longer-term signals point toward investments in dynamic reactive assets, grid-forming controls, and targeted synchronous condensers where economics allow. What to monitor: testing schedules, emergency operating procedures, and any temporary derating notices from transmission operators.",
