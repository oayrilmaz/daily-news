      "body": "Across modeled scenarios, AI-enabled decision aids appear to be shifting certain routine dispatch and contingency tasks from human operators to algorithmic layers.\nThis shift can lower response times in stress events but also concentrates decision logic in opaque models that produce new failure modes.\nOperators that layer AI without commensurate logging, explainability, and roll-back controls may face scenario risks where automated actions propagate unexpected grid states.\nSeparately, adversary red teams are characterizing how small data corruptions or spoofed telemetry could mislead automated controllers in ways that are hard to detect by traditional alarms.\nRegulatory and internal governance signals are trending toward requirements for audit trails, model versioning, and human-in-the-loop thresholds for high-impact actions.\nVendor selection and integration practices now matter as much as algorithm performance; heterogeneity in control stacks amplifies test and verification burdens.\nWhat to monitor: anomaly rates in supervisory control logs, procurement notices citing model explainability, and pilot outcomes that reference rollback and kill-switch tests.",
