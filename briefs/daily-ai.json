Expectations are that these pilots will focus first on urban substations and major transmission corridors. Scenario watch includes faster prioritization of hospitals, pumping stations, and data centers during multi-node outages. What to monitor are procurement notices referencing “AI dispatch” or “restoration optimization” and changing workforce training plans. Vendors may push integrated offerings that blend SCADA data with machine learning models.
