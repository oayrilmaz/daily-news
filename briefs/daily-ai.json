      "body": "Grid operators may face compressed reserves as thermal retirements reduce baseline capacity. Load forecasts are showing pockets of higher-than-typical residential and commercial demand during cold snaps. Renewable output variability could amplify the challenge if wind and solar underperform against forecast. Gas-fired and hydro ramping capability will be critical in short-duration events. Distribution-level constraints may produce localized outages if contingency plans are not executed. Market mechanisms for shortage pricing could be triggered more frequently under stressed scenarios. Transmission congestion could complicate transfers between supply-rich and demand-heavy areas. What to monitor: real-time reserve notices, emergency operating procedures, and DSO/TO coordination memos.",
