Expectations are that pilots will focus first on constrained feeders and areas with high DER penetration. Scenario watch: models may surface new operational modes that change how reserves are procured. This could ripple into market rules if AI-suggested actions conflict with existing dispatch protocols. There is an emerging expectation that regulators will ask for explainability and audit trails before approving wide operational use. Equipment procurement teams may need to account for higher telemetry bandwidth and storage needs. What to monitor are regulatory consultation notes, vendor product roadmaps, and pilot performance metrics shared in industry forums.",
