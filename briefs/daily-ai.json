Grid operators may face more frequent need to call on flexibility and emergency reserves, especially in constrained corridors. Distributed loads from electrified heating and transport are amplifying peak demands in urban feeders. Transmission projects in permitting or late-stage construction are unlikely to materially relieve near-term constraints. Expect increased reliance on fast-start units and contractual demand-response arrangements in short windows. Scenario watch: rolling contingencies could expose transformer and line vulnerabilities in heavily loaded substations.",
