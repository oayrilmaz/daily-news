Grid operators are likely monitoring short-duration ramp events tied to cold-weather demand spikes. Inverter-dominated areas may show different response patterns compared with synchronous-heavy regions. Expectations include greater reliance on fast-ramping resources and emergency procurement in constrained zones. Scenario watch: localized redispatch and conservation appeals under low-probability, high-impact spikes. What to monitor are reserve notices and ancillary services procurement over the next 48 hours.",

This is driving investment in hybrid strategies that combine firm backup with market-aware flexible loads. Scenario watch: more aggressive participation in demand response programs under short-notice price spikes. What to monitor are day-ahead and real-time price spreads that change operator dispatch decisions.
