      "body": "Grid operators face a mix of elevated heating demand and pockets of behind-the-meter solar and storage output that shift net load shapes in unpredictable ways.\nThis convergence is producing more frequent re-dispatch events and narrower reserve margins in specific regions, based on operational signals.\nOperators are reportedly leaning harder on fast-ramping gas assets and battery storage to manage intra-day swings, which raises fuel and cycling considerations for asset owners.\nPlanned outages and maintenance windows are under scrutiny; postponements are a plausible scenario where margin tightness persists.\nSecondary effects include greater wear on frequency regulation resources and higher short-term market volatility for ancillary services.\nCoordination between transmission planners and distribution aggregators is a focal point; gaps in telemetry remain a recurring friction.\nWhat to monitor are reserve alerts, battery state-of-charge swings, and communications from balancing authorities about curtailment risk.",
