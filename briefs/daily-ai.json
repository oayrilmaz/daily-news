Expectations are that some developers will delay procurement to wait for price stabilization, which could compress supply and prolong volatility. Contract design is shifting toward modular deliveries and indexed pricing in several scenarios. Financial sponsors are reassessing underwriting assumptions for multi-year projects where technology cost trajectories are uncertain.
