These initiatives appear to compress response times but also shift failure modes from mechanical to algorithmic. Scenario watch: model drift and data quality issues could create subtle reliability risks if not integrated with rigorous validation protocols. Expectations include more hybrid control architectures where human oversight is retained but routine adjustments are automated. Vendors are positioning software modules as low-friction add-ons to existing SCADA systems, which may hide integration complexity. Procurement teams could face new vendor lock and update cadence challenges. Cybersecurity requirements are increasingly cited as gating items in procurement dialogues. What to monitor: certificate and update management processes, and the appetite of regulators for mandatory explainability standards.",
