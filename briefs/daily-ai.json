The intelligence picture shows increased instances of rapid active power swings during low-temperature, high-load periods. These swings can exacerbate frequency and voltage regulation burdens at the sub-transmission level. Utilities are expected to revisit DER aggregation protocols and telemetry requirements to shorten response times.
