      "body": "Operators are increasingly trialing AI to optimize unit commitment, voltage control and contingency ranking. These deployments reduce response times and human workload under normal conditions. However, early signals point to opaque failure modes when AI policies interact across neighboring control domains. Expectations include transient coordination mismatches and unexpected automated remedial actions during stress conditions. Scenario watch: adversarial inputs or unmodeled boundary conditions could trigger cascading automated responses. What to monitor are rollbacks to manual supervision and incident reports that note AI-influenced decision chains. Vendors are responding with explainability features but integration remains uneven across fleets. The near-term balance will be between operational gains and the need for tighter governance and cross-border coordination.",

This increases insulation aging and digestible fault risks even without headline failures. Expectations are more frequent thermal alarms and targeted outages for end-of-life units. Scenario watch suggests that correlated end-of-season maintenance windows could produce temporary capacity shortfalls in constrained regions. What to monitor are short-term work orders and unplanned load-shedding notifications tied to transformer replacement delays. OEM lead times for large power transformers remain long, compounding replacement timelines. Operators should consider triage prioritization based on contingency analyses and spare inventory deployments. There is also signal value in thermal imaging and dissolved gas analysis cadence adjustments.",
