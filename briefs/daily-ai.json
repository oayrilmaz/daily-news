      "body": "System-level inertia is trending lower as synchronous generation retires and inverter-based capacity rises. This shift increases the speed of frequency change during disturbances and compresses the time window for grid protections and operator interventions. Grid operators and planners are signaling expectations for new control schemes and faster telemetry to manage these dynamics. Aggregated—rather than single-asset—responses are becoming more important, which elevates the role of DER orchestration and virtual synchronous machine algorithms. There is a scenario where legacy relays and under-frequency load shedding thresholds prove insufficient without coordinated updates. Market mechanisms that reward fast frequency response are being tested conceptually but adoption remains uneven. What to monitor are documented tests of synthetic inertia, shifts in telemetry requirements, and preliminary rule changes that could force accelerated retrofits.",

Some utilities may start prioritizing strategic spares for high-consequence sites while accepting longer repair windows elsewhere.
