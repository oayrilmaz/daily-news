These modeling signals show different fault response and frequency nadir outcomes compared with traditional synchronous-dominant scenarios. The shift amplifies demand for fast-acting synthetic inertia, coordinated protection settings, and revised grid codes. There is an expectation that short-term operational mitigations will become routine while longer-term investments in controls and HVDC links are debated. Equipment OEMs are reporting demand for inverters with enhanced grid-support features in scenario planning discussions. What to monitor: whether balancing authorities issue temporary operating measures or requirement updates for inverter ride-through and frequency response.",
