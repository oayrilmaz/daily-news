      "body": "Grid operators are reporting patterns consistent with reduced short-circuit strength in areas with concentrated inverter connections. These patterns appear to change how under-frequency and over-frequency events evolve. Protection schemes tuned for synchronous machine behavior may not perform as expected in these pockets. There is an expectation that more adaptive or grid-forming inverter controls will be trialed to fill the gap. Equipment vendors may propose firmware updates and retuning rather than hardware replacements as an interim step. Scenario units should model low-inertia events across a range of DER penetration levels to assess impacts on relay coordination. What to monitor next are frequency nadir depths and recovery profiles in system event logs. Asset owners should consider stress-testing islanding and reconnection sequences under inverter-dense conditions.",

Contractors may need to re-evaluate staging and temporary power strategies where phased energization was planned. Inventory buffers are under review across EPCs, with some groups expanding spare pools where feasible.
