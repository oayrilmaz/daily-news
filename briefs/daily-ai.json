      "body": "Operational telemetry indicates shorter-duration frequency deviations during morning ramp periods in areas with high renewable penetration. These deviations align with anticipated gaps in fast-acting grid-forming capability rather than sustained capacity shortfalls. System operators are increasingly drawing on battery resources and demand-response programs to bridge seconds-to-minutes gaps. There is a scenario risk where delayed activation of distributed resources amplifies price and reliability stress. Grid planners are expected to prioritize inverter control upgrades and procurement of synthetic inertia in upcoming solicitations. What to monitor: dispatch patterns for fast reserves and any emergency transmission constraints reported in operator notices.",

This divergence suggests localized stressors — overload cycles, ingress, or maintenance gaps — rather than a single design fault. Utilities are expected to triage on risk metrics, accelerating replacements where outage impact is highest. Procurement teams may face lead-time pressures if multiple replacement orders are raised concurrently. There is an expectation that asset owners will increase condition-based monitoring investments to refine prioritization.
