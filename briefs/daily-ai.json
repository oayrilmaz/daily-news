      "body": "Grid operators are reporting patterns consistent with higher winter peak risks when cold-weather demand spikes align with low thermal plant availability. System flexibility metrics are increasingly driven by inverter behavior rather than synchronous inertia. Expectations include tighter ramp margins in evening shoulder hours and more frequent activation of fast-response assets. Scenario watch: localized voltage collapse risk in heavy distribution-load pockets if reactive reserves are thin. Planning implications include accelerated procurement of dynamic reactive support and reassessment of dark-start strategies. What to monitor: outage schedules for major thermal units, short-term weather-driven load revisions, and frequency of distribution-level inverter curtailments.",

Operators face trade-offs between extending run-to-failure risk and scheduling outages amid tight transmission needs. The dependence on specialized replacement modules makes contingency planning more complex and costly. Expectations include more targeted condition-based maintenance and selective prioritization of critical nodes. What to monitor are extended lead-time invoices from contract manufacturers and cross-border logistics indicators that could lengthen downtime. Near-term procurement strategies are likely to include pooled spares and cross-operator mutual-aid agreements to mitigate single-point failures.",
