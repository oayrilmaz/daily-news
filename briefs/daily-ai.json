Expectations center on reduced reliance on conservative thermal limits and more dynamic line ratings when models are validated. Scenario watch includes faster relief for near-term limits without immediate capital projects, but with increased operational complexity. What to monitor are nodal market notices and pilot program statements referencing ML-assisted forecasts. Integration risks include model drift, data quality gaps, and the need for human-in-the-loop safeguards. Vendors will likely emphasize explainability and audit trails to placate compliance teams. A middle-ground expectation is incremental rollouts in non-critical corridors before expansion into bulk transmission.",

Reuse and standardized designs could lower engineering hours but will require stricter interface management with local civil works. A potential friction point is transport and on-site cranage for large skids, particularly in dense urban or constrained rural sites. Vendors may push integrated warranties to address end-to-end performance accountability. Project owners should expect to trade some site customization flexibility for time certainty.",
