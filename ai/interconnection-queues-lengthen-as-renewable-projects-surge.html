<h1>Interconnection Queues Lengthen as Renewable Projects Surge</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Widely reported by utilities and regulatory bodies.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Growing renewable generation interconnection requests are causing significant delays in grid connection approvals.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Delays slow renewable capacity additions critical for decarbonization.</li><li>Increased costs and uncertainty for project developers.</li><li>Grid planning and upgrades are strained by backlog.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Interconnection queues in major US regions have grown substantially.</li><li>Grid operators face resource constraints to process applications.</li><li>Technical studies and system upgrades add to timelines.</li><li>Some regions are reforming interconnection procedures.</li><li>Energy storage projects are increasingly included in queues.</li><li>Policy interventions are being considered to accelerate approvals.</li><li>Developers face financial risks due to prolonged wait times.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Regulatory changes to streamline interconnection processes.</li><li>Investment in grid upgrades to accommodate new generation.</li><li>Emerging technologies to facilitate faster interconnection.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of procedural reforms in reducing queue times.</li><li>Impact of interconnection delays on overall renewable deployment targets.</li><li>Potential for market-based solutions to manage queue backlogs.</li></ul>
