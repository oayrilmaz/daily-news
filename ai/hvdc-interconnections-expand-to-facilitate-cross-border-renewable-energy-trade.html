<h1>HVDC Interconnections Expand to Facilitate Cross-Border Renewable Energy Trade</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple governments and utilities have announced or commissioned HVDC projects in the past 12 months.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links are increasingly used to connect national grids, enabling efficient long-distance renewable energy transmission.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enhances cross-border energy exchange and grid resilience.</li><li>Reduces transmission losses over long distances.</li><li>Supports integration of remote renewable generation sites.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology is preferred for underwater and underground cables.</li><li>Projects in Europe and Asia are leading HVDC expansion efforts.</li><li>Modular multilevel converters improve control and efficiency.</li><li>Interconnection capacity is increasing to balance supply and demand.</li><li>HVDC reduces the need for synchronous grid operation between regions.</li><li>Costs remain high but are decreasing with technological advances.</li><li>Policy frameworks are evolving to support cross-border HVDC projects.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Progress on North Sea offshore HVDC grid initiatives.</li><li>Commissioning of new Asia-Pacific HVDC links.</li><li>Regulatory developments in cross-border energy markets.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term interoperability standards between different HVDC systems.</li><li>Impact of geopolitical tensions on cross-border projects.</li><li>Future cost trajectories as technology matures.</li></ul>
