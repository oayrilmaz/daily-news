<h1>Synchronous Condensers as a Solution for Inertia Deficit</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple grid operators have successfully commissioned synchronous condensers recently.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Synchronous condensers are increasingly deployed to provide inertia and reactive power support in grids with high renewable penetration.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Maintains grid frequency stability amid declining synchronous generation.</li><li>Improves voltage regulation and fault current levels.</li><li>Enables higher renewable energy integration without compromising reliability.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Synchronous condensers provide rotating inertia without active power generation.</li><li>They support grid voltage through reactive power injection.</li><li>Installation costs are significant but justified by grid stability benefits.</li><li>Retrofit of existing generators as synchronous condensers is an option.</li><li>Deployment is concentrated in regions with rapid coal and gas plant retirements.</li><li>Complementary to battery energy storage systems for grid services.</li><li>Operational experience is growing, informing best practices.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>New projects in high-renewable regions like California and Germany.</li><li>Technological improvements reducing synchronous condenser costs.</li><li>Policy incentives supporting inertia provision technologies.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term maintenance costs and lifecycle of synchronous condensers.</li><li>Optimal sizing and placement within transmission networks.</li><li>Integration with emerging grid-forming inverter technologies.</li></ul>
