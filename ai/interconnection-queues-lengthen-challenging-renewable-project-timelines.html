<h1>Interconnection Queues Lengthen, Challenging Renewable Project Timelines</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Data from regional transmission organizations confirm record backlogs and processing delays.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Extended interconnection queue times are delaying renewable energy projects, impacting capacity additions and grid planning.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Slows decarbonization efforts reliant on renewables.</li><li>Increases project development costs and risks.</li><li>Pressures grid operators to enhance interconnection processes.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Queue backlogs exceed several years in major US regions.</li><li>Interconnection studies are resource-intensive and complex.</li><li>Grid upgrades needed to accommodate new generation are costly and time-consuming.</li><li>Regulatory reforms are proposed to streamline processes.</li><li>Developers pursue alternative connection strategies, including hybrid projects.</li><li>Technological solutions like advanced modeling are being deployed.</li><li>Stakeholder engagement is increasing to address bottlenecks.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Implementation of interconnection reform policies.</li><li>Technological tools improving queue management.</li><li>Trends in project cancellations due to delays.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of proposed reforms in reducing wait times.</li><li>Long-term impacts on renewable capacity targets.</li><li>Potential for new market mechanisms to alleviate congestion.</li></ul>
