<h1>HVDC Interconnection Growth Accelerates Cross-Border Power Trade</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Several HVDC projects have reached advanced construction phases with confirmed financing.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links are expanding to facilitate efficient cross-border electricity exchange.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables long-distance, low-loss power transmission.</li><li>Supports grid interconnection and energy market integration.</li><li>Facilitates renewable energy export/import between regions.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology reduces transmission losses compared to AC lines.</li><li>New projects are focused in Europe, Asia, and North America.</li><li>Voltage levels typically range from ±320 kV to ±800 kV.</li><li>Converter station costs remain a significant portion of total investment.</li><li>Interconnection capacity is increasing to support renewable integration.</li><li>Grid operators report improved system flexibility and reliability.</li><li>Challenges include regulatory coordination and permitting delays.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Completion status of North Sea HVDC interconnectors.</li><li>Advances in multi-terminal HVDC systems.</li><li>Policy developments affecting cross-border grid projects.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term reliability of new converter technologies.</li><li>Impact of geopolitical tensions on cross-border projects.</li><li>Future cost reductions through technology maturation.</li></ul>
