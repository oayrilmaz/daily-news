<h1>HVDC Interconnection Projects Accelerate to Support Cross-Border Renewable Energy Trade</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Confirmed project pipelines and government support for regional grid integration initiatives.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnections are expanding globally to enable efficient cross-border transmission of renewable energy.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Facilitates large-scale renewable energy sharing between regions with complementary resources.</li><li>Reduces transmission losses over long distances compared to AC lines.</li><li>Enhances grid resilience and energy security through diversified supply.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology allows asynchronous grid interconnection and precise power flow control.</li><li>Europe, Asia, and North America lead in HVDC project development for renewable integration.</li><li>Projects include subsea cables, overhead lines, and hybrid AC/DC corridors.</li><li>Government policies and climate targets are key drivers for HVDC investments.</li><li>Technical challenges include converter station costs and grid compatibility.</li><li>Emerging modular multi-level converter (MMC) technology improves efficiency and scalability.</li><li>HVDC links support grid stability by controlling power flows and mitigating congestion.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Progress on major HVDC projects connecting offshore wind farms to mainland grids.</li><li>Regulatory frameworks facilitating cross-border electricity trade.</li><li>Advancements in converter technologies reducing costs and losses.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Project timelines affected by permitting and geopolitical factors.</li><li>Long-term maintenance and operational challenges in harsh environments.</li><li>Integration impact on existing AC grid infrastructure and market dynamics.</li></ul>
