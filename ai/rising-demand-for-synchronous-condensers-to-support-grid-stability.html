<h1>Rising Demand for Synchronous Condensers to Support Grid Stability</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple grid operators have publicly confirmed ongoing projects and investments in synchronous condensers.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Synchronous condensers are increasingly deployed to enhance grid stability amid rising renewable penetration and phase-out of conventional generators.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Improves voltage regulation and reactive power support on grids.</li><li>Facilitates integration of intermittent renewable energy sources.</li><li>Mitigates grid reliability risks from retiring thermal plants.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Synchronous condensers provide inertia and reactive power without energy generation.</li><li>Several US and European utilities have announced new synchronous condenser installations.</li><li>They help stabilize frequency and voltage fluctuations on weak grids.</li><li>Deployment is seen as a cost-effective alternative to battery storage for certain grid services.</li><li>Manufacturers report increased order backlogs for synchronous condenser equipment.</li><li>Grid codes in some regions are evolving to incentivize synchronous condenser use.</li><li>Operational experience from recent projects shows improved grid resilience.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>New synchronous condenser projects announced by major utilities.</li><li>Regulatory changes affecting grid support services.</li><li>Technological advances in synchronous condenser design.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term maintenance costs and operational lifespan in diverse grid conditions.</li><li>Impact on overall grid economics compared to alternative solutions.</li><li>Potential scalability limits in very high renewable penetration scenarios.</li></ul>
