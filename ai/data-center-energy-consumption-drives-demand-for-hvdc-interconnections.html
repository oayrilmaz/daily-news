<h1>Data Center Energy Consumption Drives Demand for HVDC Interconnections</h1>

<p><strong>Medium confidence</strong> — Industry reports indicate growing HVDC projects linked to data center clusters, though some plans remain in early stages.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>The surge in data center capacity is accelerating the deployment of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links to meet localized power demands efficiently.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC enables efficient long-distance power transmission with lower losses.</li><li>Supports reliability for energy-intensive data centers.</li><li>Facilitates integration of renewable energy sources into data center supply.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Data centers require stable, high-capacity power feeds.</li><li>HVDC links reduce transmission losses compared to AC lines.</li><li>Projects are concentrated near major data center hubs in the US and Asia.</li><li>HVDC supports asynchronous grid interconnections.</li><li>Enables direct renewable power sourcing for data centers.</li><li>Capital costs are high but offset by operational efficiencies.</li><li>Grid operators are adapting planning to accommodate HVDC.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Announcements of new HVDC projects near data center clusters.</li><li>Technological advances in converter stations.</li><li>Policy developments supporting HVDC infrastructure.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Timeline for full commissioning of planned HVDC links.</li><li>Impact on local grid stability during ramp-up phases.</li><li>Future scalability of HVDC to meet expanding data center demand.</li></ul>
