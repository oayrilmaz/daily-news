<h1>High Voltage Equipment Aging Raises Reliability Concerns</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Asset age profiles and failure statistics are well documented by utilities.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Aging high voltage equipment in many grids is increasing failure risks, prompting accelerated replacement and refurbishment programs.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Failures can cause major outages and safety hazards.</li><li>Replacement programs require significant capital investment.</li><li>Aging assets may limit grid flexibility and renewable integration.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Many HV transformers and switchgear have exceeded original design life.</li><li>Failure rates increase sharply beyond 30-40 years of service.</li><li>Utilities prioritize critical asset replacement based on risk assessments.</li><li>Refurbishment can extend life but may not address all reliability issues.</li><li>Budget constraints challenge timely asset renewal.</li><li>Integration of new equipment must consider compatibility with legacy systems.</li><li>Regulatory pressure to maintain high reliability standards.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Utility capital expenditure plans for asset replacement.</li><li>Technological advances in HV equipment longevity.</li><li>Regulatory updates on asset management requirements.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Impact of accelerated replacement on utility financials.</li><li>Potential for innovative refurbishment techniques.</li><li>Effect of aging equipment on grid resilience under stress.</li></ul>
