<h1>High Voltage Equipment Aging Raises Reliability Concerns</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Utility asset age profiles and failure incident reports confirm rising concerns.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Aging high voltage equipment in many grids is increasing failure risks, prompting accelerated replacement and refurbishment programs.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Potential for increased outages and grid reliability issues.</li><li>Significant capital investments needed for equipment renewal.</li><li>Opportunity to integrate modern technologies during replacements.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Many transformers, circuit breakers, and switchgear exceed original design lifespans.</li><li>Condition assessment techniques increasingly used to prioritize replacements.</li><li>Refurbishment can extend life but may not address all reliability risks.</li><li>Budget constraints challenge timely asset renewal.</li><li>New equipment offers improved efficiency and monitoring capabilities.</li><li>Coordination required to minimize operational disruptions during replacements.</li><li>Regulatory pressure increasing for utilities to demonstrate asset health management.</li></ul>
</section>
