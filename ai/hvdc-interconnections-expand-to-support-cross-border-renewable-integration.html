<h1>HVDC Interconnections Expand to Support Cross-Border Renewable Integration</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple confirmed projects under construction and planned in Europe and Asia.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High-voltage direct current (HVDC) links are increasingly deployed to facilitate cross-border power exchange and renewable energy integration.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC enables efficient long-distance power transmission with lower losses.</li><li>Supports grid stability by linking asynchronous systems.</li><li>Facilitates renewable energy trade across regions.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology reduces transmission constraints over long distances.</li><li>Projects often connect offshore wind farms to mainland grids.</li><li>Multi-terminal HVDC systems are emerging for complex interconnections.</li><li>Converters and control systems are critical components.</li><li>Costs remain high but offset by operational efficiencies.</li><li>Regulatory coordination is essential for cross-border projects.</li><li>Energy markets benefit from increased interconnection capacity.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Status updates on major HVDC projects globally.</li><li>Technological advances in HVDC converter stations.</li><li>Policy frameworks facilitating cross-border energy trade.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Future cost reductions from HVDC technology improvements.</li><li>Impact of geopolitical factors on cross-border interconnections.</li><li>Integration challenges with existing AC grids.</li></ul>
