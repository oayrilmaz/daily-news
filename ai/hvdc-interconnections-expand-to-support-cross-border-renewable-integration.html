<h1>HVDC Interconnections Expand to Support Cross-Border Renewable Integration</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Several confirmed HVDC projects under construction and in planning stages globally.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) projects are accelerating to facilitate large-scale renewable energy transfer across regions and countries.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables efficient long-distance power transmission with lower losses.</li><li>Supports balancing of variable renewable generation across diverse grids.</li><li>Facilitates energy market integration and security.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology preferred for underwater and underground cables.</li><li>Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC) improve HVDC flexibility.</li><li>Projects often exceed 500 km in length, connecting distant grids.</li><li>Costs remain high but offset by reduced transmission losses.</li><li>Grid codes evolving to accommodate HVDC interconnections.</li><li>Interconnection capacity is increasing in Europe and Asia.</li><li>Maintenance and operational expertise are critical for reliability.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Commissioning dates of major HVDC links.</li><li>Policy support for cross-border interconnections.</li><li>Technological improvements in converter stations.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term reliability of new HVDC components under diverse conditions.</li><li>Impact of geopolitical tensions on cross-border projects.</li><li>Future scalability of HVDC systems with growing renewable capacity.</li></ul>
