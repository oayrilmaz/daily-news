<h1>Interconnection of Offshore Wind Farms via HVDC Systems</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Supported by multiple operational projects and industry investment trends.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>HVDC technology is increasingly utilized for connecting offshore wind farms to onshore grids, improving transmission efficiency and reliability.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables large-scale offshore wind development in distant locations.</li><li>Reduces transmission losses compared to AC alternatives.</li><li>Facilitates multi-terminal grid connections and power flow control.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Voltage source converter (VSC) HVDC is preferred for offshore applications.</li><li>Subsea cables and converter stations are critical infrastructure components.</li><li>Project costs are high but justified by long-term operational benefits.</li><li>Integration with onshore grid requires advanced control systems.</li><li>Environmental considerations influence route and installation methods.</li><li>Standardization efforts aim to reduce costs and improve interoperability.</li><li>Grid codes are evolving to accommodate HVDC-connected offshore assets.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>New offshore wind HVDC project announcements.</li><li>Technological advances in subsea cable materials.</li><li>Regulatory developments for offshore grid integration.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
