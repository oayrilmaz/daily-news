<h1>HVDC Transmission Projects Accelerate for Cross-Border Power Exchange</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Several HVDC projects have secured financing and are under construction globally.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines are increasingly favored for cross-border interconnections to enhance grid flexibility and renewable integration.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Facilitates efficient long-distance power transfer with lower losses.</li><li>Enables integration of variable renewable energy across regions.</li><li>Strengthens energy security through diversified supply sources.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC lines reduce transmission losses compared to AC over long distances.</li><li>Projects link grids across countries with asynchronous systems.</li><li>Technology supports bidirectional power flow and grid balancing.</li><li>Costs remain high but are offset by operational savings and capacity benefits.</li><li>Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC) improve HVDC system reliability.</li><li>Environmental permitting remains a key challenge for new corridors.</li><li>Digital control systems enhance HVDC operational flexibility.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Progress of major HVDC projects in Europe and Asia.</li><li>Regulatory frameworks for cross-border power trading.</li><li>Advances in converter technology and grid integration.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term impacts on regional market dynamics.</li><li>Potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities in HVDC control systems.</li><li>Scalability of HVDC for future ultra-high capacity corridors.</li></ul>
