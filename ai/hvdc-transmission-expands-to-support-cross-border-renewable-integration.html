<h1>HVDC Transmission Expands to Support Cross-Border Renewable Integration</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Several HVDC projects have reached financial close or construction phase recently.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) projects are accelerating to facilitate cross-border renewable power exchange.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables efficient long-distance power transmission with reduced losses.</li><li>Supports grid interconnection between asynchronous systems.</li><li>Facilitates renewable energy balancing across regions.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC lines are preferred for underwater and underground transmission.</li><li>Technological improvements have increased capacity and reduced costs.</li><li>Interconnection projects in Europe and Asia are leading the trend.</li><li>HVDC supports grid stability by controlling power flows precisely.</li><li>Converter station technology advances improve reliability and efficiency.</li><li>Project timelines remain lengthy due to permitting and engineering complexity.</li><li>Integration with existing AC grids requires sophisticated control systems.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Progress on major HVDC corridor projects in Europe and Asia.</li><li>Innovations in converter technology and modular designs.</li><li>Regulatory frameworks enabling cross-border electricity trade.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term impacts on grid dynamics and market operations.</li><li>Cost trajectories as projects scale globally.</li><li>Potential environmental and social acceptance challenges.</li></ul>
