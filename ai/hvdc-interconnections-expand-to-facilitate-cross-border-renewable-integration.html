<h1>HVDC Interconnections Expand to Facilitate Cross-Border Renewable Integration</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Several HVDC projects are in advanced stages or recently commissioned in Europe and Asia.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links are increasingly deployed to connect national grids and optimize renewable energy flows across borders.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables efficient long-distance power transmission with lower losses.</li><li>Supports balancing of variable renewable generation across regions.</li><li>Enhances energy security through diversified supply sources.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology reduces transmission losses compared to AC lines over long distances.</li><li>Projects like North Sea Link and China’s cross-provincial HVDC corridors are benchmarks.</li><li>Converter station costs remain a significant portion of project budgets.</li><li>Multi-terminal HVDC systems are emerging but face technical challenges.</li><li>Integration with existing AC grids requires advanced control systems.</li><li>Policy frameworks are evolving to support cross-border HVDC development.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Progress on multi-terminal HVDC pilot projects.</li><li>Regulatory harmonization for cross-border power trading.</li><li>Innovations in HVDC converter technologies.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Scalability of multi-terminal HVDC networks.</li><li>Long-term reliability of HVDC components under high renewable penetration.</li><li>Impact of geopolitical factors on cross-border HVDC projects.</li></ul>
