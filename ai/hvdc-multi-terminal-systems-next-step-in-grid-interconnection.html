<h1>HVDC Multi-Terminal Systems: Next Step in Grid Interconnection</h1>

<p><strong>Medium confidence</strong> — Several demonstration projects exist, but large-scale commercial adoption is still emerging.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Multi-terminal HVDC systems are progressing from pilot projects to commercial deployment, enabling more flexible and resilient grid interconnections.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Facilitates integration of diverse renewable resources across regions.</li><li>Enhances grid reliability through multiple power flow paths.</li><li>Reduces transmission losses compared to AC alternatives.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Multi-terminal HVDC allows multiple injection and withdrawal points on the DC network.</li><li>Control complexity increases with the number of terminals.</li><li>Standardization of protection and control schemes is ongoing.</li><li>Cost remains higher than point-to-point HVDC but offers operational benefits.</li><li>Projects in Europe and Asia are leading in multi-terminal HVDC deployment.</li><li>Technology advances include voltage source converters and modular designs.</li><li>Grid operators are developing operational protocols for multi-terminal systems.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Commercial commissioning of multi-terminal HVDC projects.</li><li>Development of industry standards and best practices.</li><li>Economic analyses comparing multi-terminal HVDC to traditional solutions.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
