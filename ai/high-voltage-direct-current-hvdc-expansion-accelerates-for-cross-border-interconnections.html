<h1>High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Expansion Accelerates for Cross-Border Interconnections</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Confirmed project pipelines and government support for HVDC interconnectors are well documented.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>HVDC technology is increasingly deployed to facilitate cross-border electricity trade and integrate offshore renewables.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables efficient long-distance power transmission with reduced losses.</li><li>Supports integration of offshore wind and remote renewable resources.</li><li>Enhances energy security through diversified supply routes.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC lines have lower transmission losses compared to AC over long distances.</li><li>Several multi-gigawatt HVDC projects are under construction or planning.</li><li>Modular multilevel converters improve system flexibility and control.</li><li>Cross-border interconnections facilitate market coupling and price stability.</li><li>Challenges include high upfront capital costs and permitting delays.</li><li>Technological improvements are reducing converter station footprint.</li><li>Integration with existing AC grids requires advanced control schemes.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Progress on major HVDC projects in Europe and Asia.</li><li>Policy frameworks supporting cross-border transmission.</li><li>Advancements in converter technology and standardization.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term reliability of new HVDC converter technologies.</li><li>Impact of geopolitical tensions on cross-border projects.</li><li>Cost trajectories as projects scale up.</li></ul>
