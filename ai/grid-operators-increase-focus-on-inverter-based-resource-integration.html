<h1>Grid Operators Increase Focus on Inverter-Based Resource Integration</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple grid codes and operational guidelines have been updated recently to address IBR challenges.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Grid operators are adapting operational protocols to better integrate inverter-based resources (IBRs) like solar and battery storage.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>IBRs lack traditional inertia, affecting grid stability.</li><li>New control strategies are needed for frequency and voltage regulation.</li><li>Successful integration enables higher renewable penetration.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Grid codes now require IBRs to provide grid support functions.</li><li>Synthetic inertia and fast frequency response are being implemented.</li><li>Advanced forecasting improves grid management with IBRs.</li><li>Communication protocols between IBRs and grid operators are evolving.</li><li>Testing and certification standards for IBR equipment are expanding.</li><li>Operational experience is informing continuous grid code updates.</li><li>Energy storage paired with IBRs enhances grid flexibility.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Grid code revisions related to inverter-based resources.</li><li>Technological advances in IBR grid support capabilities.</li><li>Pilot projects demonstrating advanced IBR integration.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term impacts of high IBR penetration on grid reliability.</li><li>Cost implications of enhanced grid support requirements.</li><li>Evolution of market mechanisms to value IBR grid services.</li></ul>
