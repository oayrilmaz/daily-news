<h1>Grid Stability Challenges Intensify with Increasing Renewable Penetration</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Grid operator reports and academic studies document stability issues in multiple markets.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High shares of inverter-based renewable generation are creating operational challenges for grid frequency and voltage stability.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Maintaining reliable power supply requires new stability solutions.</li><li>Grid codes and operational practices must evolve.</li><li>Investment in ancillary services and grid-forming technologies is needed.</li></ul>
