<h1>Rising Demand for Synchronous Condensers Enhances Grid Stability</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple grid operators report successful integration and performance improvements with synchronous condensers.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Synchronous condensers are increasingly deployed to support grid stability amid rising renewable penetration and inverter-based resources.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Improves voltage regulation and reactive power support.</li><li>Facilitates higher renewable energy integration.</li><li>Reduces grid disturbances and blackout risks.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
