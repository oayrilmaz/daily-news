<h1>HVDC Transmission Projects Gain Momentum for Long-Distance Power Transfer</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Multiple large-scale HVDC projects have reached advanced development stages globally.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology is increasingly selected for interregional transmission projects to enhance capacity and reduce losses.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables efficient long-distance bulk power transfer.</li><li>Facilitates integration of remote renewable resources.</li><li>Supports grid interconnection and reliability.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC lines have lower transmission losses compared to HVAC over long distances.</li><li>Projects in Europe and Asia are expanding cross-border power flows.</li><li>Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC allows better grid control and black start capability.</li><li>Costs remain high but are offset by operational savings and capacity benefits.</li><li>Environmental impact is reduced due to smaller right-of-way requirements.</li><li>HVDC supports asynchronous grid interconnections.</li><li>Technology maturity is increasing with new converter station designs.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Commissioning timelines of major HVDC links in Europe and China.</li><li>Policy support for cross-border energy trade.</li><li>Innovations in converter technology and grid integration.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term reliability of new HVDC equipment under diverse grid conditions.</li><li>Economic impacts on regional electricity markets.</li><li>Future scalability limits of HVDC networks.</li></ul>
