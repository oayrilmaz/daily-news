<h1>HVDC Interconnections Expand to Facilitate Cross-Border Renewable Trade</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Confirmed commissioning of multiple HVDC projects and planned expansions in Europe and Asia.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High-voltage direct current (HVDC) links are increasingly deployed to enable efficient cross-border electricity exchange, supporting renewable energy integration.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Supports balancing of variable renewable generation across regions.</li><li>Reduces transmission losses over long distances compared to AC lines.</li><li>Enables energy market integration and security of supply.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology allows asynchronous grid interconnection.</li><li>Projects like North Sea Link and China’s HVDC corridors are operational.</li><li>Costs remain high but justified by enhanced grid flexibility.</li><li>Converters and control systems are critical for stable operation.</li><li>HVDC facilitates offshore wind integration by connecting remote sites.</li><li>Policy frameworks increasingly support cross-border HVDC development.</li><li>Challenges include permitting, environmental impact, and grid compatibility.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>New HVDC project approvals and financing announcements.</li><li>Technological advances in converter efficiency and control.</li><li>Regulatory harmonization efforts for cross-border grid operation.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term reliability of HVDC components under increasing loads.</li><li>Impact of HVDC on regional market prices and grid dynamics.</li><li>Scalability of HVDC networks with rising renewable capacity.</li></ul>
