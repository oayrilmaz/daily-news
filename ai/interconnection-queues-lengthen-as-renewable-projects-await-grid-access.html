<h1>Interconnection Queues Lengthen as Renewable Projects Await Grid Access</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Grid operator data consistently shows increasing queue lengths and wait times.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Growing backlogs in interconnection queues are delaying renewable energy projects, impacting deployment timelines and grid planning.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Delays slow renewable capacity additions critical for decarbonization targets.</li><li>Increase project development costs and financing risks.</li><li>Highlight need for grid modernization and streamlined interconnection processes.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Queues in major US and European markets have grown substantially over five years.</li><li>Interconnection studies are resource-intensive and time-consuming.</li><li>Grid upgrades required to accommodate new generation add complexity.</li><li>Some regions implement reforms to accelerate queue processing.</li><li>Energy storage projects increasingly included in interconnection requests.</li><li>Market rules evolve to prioritize projects with higher readiness levels.</li><li>Delays may incentivize off-grid or behind-the-meter solutions.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Regulatory reforms targeting interconnection process efficiency.</li><li>Investment in grid infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks.</li><li>Emergence of alternative grid access models.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of recent reforms in reducing queue backlogs.</li><li>Impact of queue delays on renewable project financing.</li><li>Potential for technological solutions to streamline interconnection studies.</li></ul>
