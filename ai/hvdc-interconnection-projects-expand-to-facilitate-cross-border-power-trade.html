<h1>HVDC Interconnection Projects Expand to Facilitate Cross-Border Power Trade</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Several large HVDC projects are under construction or in advanced planning stages globally.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>High-voltage direct current (HVDC) links are being deployed at scale to connect asynchronous grids and enable efficient long-distance power transmission.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Enables integration of renewable energy across regions.</li><li>Reduces transmission losses compared to AC lines over long distances.</li><li>Enhances grid reliability through interconnections.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>HVDC technology supports asynchronous grid coupling.</li><li>Projects in Europe, Asia, and North America are progressing.</li><li>Bipole and multi-terminal HVDC configurations are being tested.</li><li>Control systems are evolving to improve stability and fault handling.</li><li>Costs remain high but are offset by operational benefits.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Completion timelines for major HVDC links in Europe.</li><li>Technological advances in multi-terminal HVDC systems.</li><li>Policy frameworks supporting cross-border interconnections.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Long-term reliability under varying grid conditions.</li><li>Economic viability in regions with lower power demand.</li><li>Impact of emerging grid codes on HVDC operations.</li></ul>
