<h1>Synchronous Condensers Gain Momentum for Grid Inertia Support</h1>

<p><strong>Medium confidence</strong> — Growing number of installations reported, but long-term operational data is limited.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Synchronous condensers are increasingly deployed to provide inertia and voltage support in grids with high renewable penetration.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Inertia is critical for frequency stability in low-synchronous generation grids.</li><li>Synchronous condensers offer a non-fossil alternative to traditional inertia sources.</li><li>They enhance voltage regulation and fault current contribution.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Synchronous condensers are retrofitted from existing generators or built new.</li><li>Deployment is prominent in regions with high wind and solar capacity.</li><li>They provide fast frequency response improving grid resilience.</li><li>Capex and Opex costs are significant but justified by grid stability benefits.</li><li>Integration challenges include site selection and grid connection agreements.</li><li>Alternative technologies like grid-forming inverters are also under development.</li><li>Policy frameworks are evolving to recognize inertia services.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Operational performance of new synchronous condenser installations.</li><li>Regulatory recognition of inertia as a grid service.</li><li>Advances in inverter-based synthetic inertia technologies.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Optimal sizing and placement strategies for synchronous condensers.</li><li>Long-term maintenance and reliability profiles.</li><li>Cost-benefit comparison with emerging synthetic inertia solutions.</li></ul>
