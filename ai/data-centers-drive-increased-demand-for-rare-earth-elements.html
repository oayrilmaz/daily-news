<h1>Data Centers Drive Increased Demand for Rare Earth Elements</h1>

<p><strong>Medium confidence</strong> — Market data indicates growing consumption, but supply chain transparency is limited.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>The expansion of data centers is contributing to rising demand for rare earth elements critical to high-efficiency power equipment.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Rare earths are essential for permanent magnets in energy-efficient motors and cooling systems.</li><li>Supply constraints could impact data center operational costs.</li><li>Geopolitical risks in rare earth sourcing affect energy infrastructure security.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Rare earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium are used in high-performance motors.</li><li>Data center growth drives demand for efficient cooling and power conversion equipment.</li><li>China dominates rare earth mining and processing capacity.</li><li>Efforts to diversify supply chains are underway but progress is gradual.</li><li>Recycling of rare earths remains limited but is gaining attention.</li><li>Price volatility has increased over the past two years.</li><li>Industry is exploring alternative materials and designs to reduce reliance.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
