<h1>Grid Interconnection Queues Lengthen as Renewable Projects Multiply</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Grid operator data consistently shows backlog increases across multiple regions.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Interconnection queues for transmission grids are growing longer, causing delays for renewable energy projects seeking grid access.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Delays slow renewable capacity additions critical to decarbonization.</li><li>Increased interconnection costs and uncertainty for developers.</li><li>Grid planning and upgrade needs intensify to accommodate growth.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Interconnection requests have increased 3-5x in some US regions over five years.</li><li>Queue backlogs can exceed several years for project approval.</li><li>Grid operators are implementing reforms to streamline processes.</li><li>Transmission upgrades are required to alleviate congestion.</li><li>Financial security requirements for developers have increased.</li><li>Some projects withdraw due to prolonged delays.</li><li>Policy initiatives aim to improve transparency and efficiency.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Regulatory reforms targeting interconnection process improvements.</li><li>Transmission expansion project announcements.</li><li>Innovations in grid planning and queue management.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of recent reforms in reducing queue times.</li><li>Future scale of renewable interconnection requests.</li><li>Impact of distributed energy resources on queue dynamics.</li></ul>
