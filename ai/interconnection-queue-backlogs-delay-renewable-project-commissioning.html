<h1>Interconnection Queue Backlogs Delay Renewable Project Commissioning</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Publicly available queue data and industry reports confirm growing backlogs and extended wait times.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Lengthy interconnection queues at regional transmission operators are causing significant delays for renewable energy projects seeking grid access.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Slows renewable capacity additions critical for decarbonization goals.</li><li>Increases project development costs and risks.</li><li>Highlights need for grid planning and process reforms.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Interconnection queues have grown by over 50% in key US regions in the past two years.</li><li>Studies and system upgrades are major bottlenecks.</li><li>Some projects withdraw due to delays and uncertainty.</li><li>Reform proposals include cluster studies and faster processes.</li><li>Grid operators are increasing staffing and automation.</li><li>Transmission expansion is critical to alleviate constraints.</li><li>Stakeholders call for regulatory support to streamline interconnection.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Regulatory decisions on interconnection reform.</li><li>Transmission project approvals and construction progress.</li><li>Renewable project announcements and cancellations.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of proposed interconnection reforms.</li><li>Future growth rates of interconnection requests.</li><li>Impact of distributed energy resources on queue dynamics.</li></ul>
