<h1>Data Center Energy Consumption Trends in 2024</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Consistent data from multiple industry reports and energy usage metrics support this trend.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Data centers continue to increase energy consumption globally, driven by cloud services and AI workloads, despite efficiency improvements.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Rising energy demand impacts grid stability and peak load management.</li><li>Increased operational costs for data center operators.</li><li>Pressure on renewable integration and carbon reduction goals.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Global data center energy use projected to grow 4-6% annually.</li><li>AI and machine learning workloads contribute disproportionately to power demand.</li><li>Efficiency gains from advanced cooling and server hardware partially offset growth.</li><li>Shift towards renewable energy sourcing by major operators is accelerating.</li><li>Edge data centers are increasing, adding complexity to grid management.</li><li>Demand response programs are being piloted with data center operators.</li><li>Energy storage integration at data centers remains limited but growing.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Advancements in liquid cooling technologies.</li><li>Regulatory developments on data center energy use.</li><li>Adoption rates of on-site renewable generation.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Impact of emerging AI models on future energy demand.</li><li>Long-term effectiveness of efficiency measures.</li><li>Potential for large-scale data center demand response participation.</li></ul>
