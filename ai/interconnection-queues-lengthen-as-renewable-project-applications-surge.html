<h1>Interconnection Queues Lengthen as Renewable Project Applications Surge</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Public utility commission reports document increasing interconnection queue times.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Utilities face growing backlogs in interconnection requests, delaying renewable energy project approvals and grid integration.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Delays slow renewable energy deployment and decarbonization goals.</li><li>Extended queues increase project costs and investor uncertainty.</li><li>Grid planning and upgrades are required to accommodate new capacity.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Interconnection queues in some regions exceed 5 years.</li><li>Grid congestion and limited capacity are primary bottlenecks.</li><li>Utilities implement cluster studies and batch processing to improve efficiency.</li><li>Cost allocation for network upgrades is a contentious issue.</li><li>Some projects withdraw due to prolonged approval timelines.</li><li>Regulators push for reforms to streamline interconnection processes.</li><li>Technological solutions like advanced grid modeling are being adopted.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Regulatory reforms targeting interconnection process improvements.</li><li>Utility investments in grid upgrades to reduce congestion.</li><li>Trends in project withdrawals or cancellations due to delays.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of new interconnection procedures in reducing wait times.</li><li>Future renewable project application volumes amid policy changes.</li><li>Impact of distributed energy resources on interconnection dynamics.</li></ul>
