<h1>Interconnection Queues Lengthen as Renewable Project Applications Surge</h1>

<p><strong>High confidence</strong> — Transmission operators have publicly reported record backlogs and extended processing times.</p>

<section>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Interconnection queues at regional transmission organizations are growing rapidly, delaying renewable energy project approvals.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul><li>Delays slow renewable capacity additions critical for decarbonization.</li><li>Extended queues increase project financing risks.</li><li>Grid planning and upgrades are needed to accommodate new resources.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Queues in some regions have grown to several years for project approval.</li><li>Interconnection studies are resource-intensive and complex.</li><li>Grid congestion and limited capacity are key bottlenecks.</li><li>Some regions are implementing reforms to streamline processes.</li><li>Developers face uncertainty impacting project timelines and costs.</li><li>Advanced modeling tools are being adopted to improve queue management.</li><li>Policy interventions may be required to accelerate interconnections.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Watchlist (next 24–48 hours)</h2>
<ul><li>Transmission operator reforms and process improvements.</li><li>Legislative actions addressing interconnection delays.</li><li>Technological solutions for grid capacity enhancement.</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Known unknowns</h2>
<ul><li>Effectiveness of reforms in reducing queue backlogs.</li><li>Long-term grid expansion plans aligned with renewable growth.</li><li>Impact of energy storage integration on interconnection dynamics.</li></ul>
